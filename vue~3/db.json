It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative, component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces of any complexity.</p>\n<p>Here is a minimal example:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\ncreateApp({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  }\n}).mount('#app')</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">import { createApp, ref } from 'vue'\n\ncreateApp({\n  setup() {\n    return {\n      count: ref(0)\n    }\n  }\n}).mount('#app')</pre></div>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;\n    Count is: {{ count }}\n  &lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p><strong>Result</strong></p>\n<p>The above example demonstrates the two core features of Vue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Declarative Rendering</strong>: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript state.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Reactivity</strong>: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may already have questions - don't worry. We will cover every little detail in the rest of the documentation. For now, please read along so you can have a high-level understanding of what Vue offers.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Prerequisites</strong><p>The rest of the documentation assumes basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics and then come back! You can check your knowledge level with these overviews for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JavaScript</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HTML</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CSS</a> if needed. Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-progressive-framework\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Progressive Framework </h2>\n<p>Vue is a framework and ecosystem that covers most of the common features needed in frontend development. But the web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancing static HTML without a build step</li>\n<li>Embedding as Web Components on any page</li>\n<li>Single-Page Application (SPA)</li>\n<li>Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</li>\n<li>Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)</li>\n<li>Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find these concepts intimidating, don't worry! The tutorial and guide only require basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge, and you should be able to follow along without being an expert in any of these.</p>\n<p>If you are an experienced developer interested in how to best integrate Vue into your stack, or you are curious about what these terms mean, we discuss them in more detail in <a href=\"extras/ways-of-using-vue\">Ways of Using Vue</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite the flexibility, the core knowledge about how Vue works is shared across all these use cases. Even if you are just a beginner now, the knowledge gained along the way will stay useful as you grow to tackle more ambitious goals in the future. If you are a veteran, you can pick the optimal way to leverage Vue based on the problems you are trying to solve, while retaining the same productivity. This is why we call Vue \"The Progressive Framework\": it's a framework that can grow with you and adapt to your needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"single-file-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Single-File Components </h2>\n<p>In most build-tool-enabled Vue projects, we author Vue components using an HTML-like file format called <strong>Single-File Component</strong> (also known as <code>*.vue</code> files, abbreviated as <strong>SFC</strong>). A Vue SFC, as the name suggests, encapsulates the component's logic (JavaScript), template (HTML), and styles (CSS) in a single file. Here's the previous example, written in SFC format:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;Count is: {{ count }}&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;style scoped&gt;\nbutton {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nconst count = ref(0)\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;Count is: {{ count }}&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;style scoped&gt;\nbutton {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre></div>\n<p>SFC is a defining feature of Vue and is the recommended way to author Vue components <strong>if</strong> your use case warrants a build setup. You can learn more about the <a href=\"scaling-up/sfc\">how and why of SFC</a> in its dedicated section - but for now, just know that Vue will handle all the build tools setup for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api-styles\" tabindex=\"-1\">API Styles </h2>\n<p>Vue components can be authored in two different API styles: <strong>Options API</strong> and <strong>Composition API</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"options-api\" tabindex=\"-1\">Options API </h3>\n<p>With Options API, we define a component's logic using an object of options such as <code>data</code>, <code>methods</code>, and <code>mounted</code>. Properties defined by options are exposed on <code>this</code> inside functions, which points to the component instance:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n  // Properties returned from data() become reactive state\n  // and will be exposed on `this`.\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n\n  // Methods are functions that mutate state and trigger updates.\n  // They can be bound as event handlers in templates.\n  methods: {\n    increment() {\n      this.count++\n    }\n  },\n\n  // Lifecycle hooks are called at different stages\n  // of a component's lifecycle.\n  // This function will be called when the component is mounted.\n  mounted() {\n    console.log(`The initial count is ${this.count}.`)\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"increment\"&gt;Count is: {{ count }}&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNptkMFqxCAQhl9lkB522ZL0HNKlpa/Qo4e1ZpLIGhUdl5bgu9es2eSyIMio833zO7NP56pbRNawNkivHJ25wV9nPUGHvYiaYOYGoK7Bo5CkbgiBBOFy2AkSh2N5APmeojePCkDaaKiBt1KnZUuv3Ky0PppMsyYAjYJgigu0oEGYDsirYUAP0WULhqVrQhptF5qHQhnpcUJD+wyQaSpUd/Xp9NysVY/yT2qE0dprIS/vsds5Mg9mNVbaDofL94jZpUgJXUKBCvAy76ZUXY53CTd5tfX2k7kgnJzOCXIF0P5EImvgQ2olr++cbRE4O3+t6JxvXj0ptXVpye1tvbFY+ge/NJZt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"composition-api\" tabindex=\"-1\">Composition API </h3>\n<p>With Composition API, we define a component's logic using imported API functions. In SFCs, Composition API is typically used with <a href=\"../api/sfc-script-setup\"><code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code></a>. The <code>setup</code> attribute is a hint that makes Vue perform compile-time transforms that allow us to use Composition API with less boilerplate. For example, imports and top-level variables / functions declared in <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> are directly usable in the template.</p>\n<p>Here is the same component, with the exact same template, but using Composition API and <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> instead:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\n// reactive state\nconst count = ref(0)\n\n// functions that mutate state and trigger updates\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++\n}\n\n// lifecycle hooks\nonMounted(() =&gt; {\n  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"increment\"&gt;Count is: {{ count }}&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpNkMFqwzAQRH9lMYU4pNg9Bye09NxbjzrEVda2iLwS0spQjP69a+yYHnRYad7MaOfiw/tqSliciybqYDxDRE7+qsiM3gWGGQJ2r+DoyyVivEOGLrgRDkIdFCmqa1G0ms2EELllVKQdRQa9AHBZ+PLtuEm7RCKVd+ChZRjTQqwctHQHDqbvMUDyd7mKip4AGNIBRyQujzArgtW/mlqb8HRSlLcEazrUv9oiDM49xGGvXgp5uT5his5iZV1f3r4HFHvDprVbaxPhZf4XkKub/CDLaep1T7IhGRhHb6WoTADNT2KWpu/aGv24qGKvrIrr5+Z7hnneQnJu6hURvKl3ryL/ARrVkuI=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"which-to-choose\" tabindex=\"-1\">Which to Choose? </h3>\n<p>Both API styles are fully capable of covering common use cases. They are different interfaces powered by the exact same underlying system. In fact, the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API! The fundamental concepts and knowledge about Vue are shared across the two styles.</p>\n<p>The Options API is centered around the concept of a \"component instance\" (<code>this</code> as seen in the example), which typically aligns better with a class-based mental model for users coming from OOP language backgrounds. It is also more beginner-friendly by abstracting away the reactivity details and enforcing code organization via option groups.</p>\n<p>The Composition API is centered around declaring reactive state variables directly in a function scope and composing state from multiple functions together to handle complexity. It is more free-form and requires an understanding of how reactivity works in Vue to be used effectively. In return, its flexibility enables more powerful patterns for organizing and reusing logic.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the comparison between the two styles and the potential benefits of Composition API in the <a href=\"extras/composition-api-faq\">Composition API FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are new to Vue, here's our general recommendation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For learning purposes, go with the style that looks easier to understand to you. Again, most of the core concepts are shared between the two styles. You can always pick up the other style later.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p>For production use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Go with Options API if you are not using build tools, or plan to use Vue primarily in low-complexity scenarios, e.g. progressive enhancement.</p></li>\n<li><p>Go with Composition API + Single-File Components if you plan to build full applications with Vue.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don't have to commit to only one style during the learning phase. The rest of the documentation will provide code samples in both styles where applicable, and you can toggle between them at any time using the <strong>API Preference switches</strong> at the top of the left sidebar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"still-got-questions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Still Got Questions? </h2>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/about/faq\">FAQ</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pick-your-learning-path\" tabindex=\"-1\">Pick Your Learning Path </h2>\n<p>Different developers have different learning styles. Feel free to pick a learning path that suits your preference - although we do recommend going over all of the content, if possible!</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/essentials/application":"<h1 id=\"creating-a-vue-application\" tabindex=\"-1\">Creating a Vue Application </h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-application-instance\" tabindex=\"-1\">The application instance </h2>\n<p>Every Vue application starts by creating a new <strong>application instance</strong> with the <a href=\"../../api/application#createapp\"><code>createApp</code></a> function:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({\n  /* root component options */\n})</pre>\n<h2 id=\"the-root-component\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Root Component </h2>\n<p>The object we are passing into <code>createApp</code> is in fact a component. Every app requires a \"root component\" that can contain other components as its children.</p>\n<p>If you are using Single-File Components, we typically import the root component from another file:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { createApp } from 'vue'\n// import the root component App from a single-file component.\nimport App from './App.vue'\n\nconst app = createApp(App)</pre>\n<p>While many examples in this guide only need a single component, most real applications are organized into a tree of nested, reusable components. For example, a Todo application's component tree might look like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"\">App (root component)\n├─ TodoList\n│  └─ TodoItem\n│     ├─ TodoDeleteButton\n│     └─ TodoEditButton\n└─ TodoFooter\n   ├─ TodoClearButton\n   └─ TodoStatistics</pre>\n<p>In later sections of the guide, we will discuss how to define and compose multiple components together. Before that, we will focus on what happens inside a single component.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mounting-the-app\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mounting the App </h2>\n<p>An application instance won't render anything until its <code>.mount()</code> method is called. It expects a \"container\" argument, which can either be an actual DOM element or a selector string:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"html\">&lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">app.mount('#app')</pre>\n<p>The content of the app's root component will be rendered inside the container element. The container element itself is not considered part of the app.</p>\n<p>The <code>.mount()</code> method should always be called after all app configurations and asset registrations are done. Also note that its return value, unlike the asset registration methods, is the root component instance instead of the application instance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-dom-root-component-template\" tabindex=\"-1\">In-DOM Root Component Template </h3>\n<p>The template for the root component is usually part of the component itself, but it is also possible to provide the template separately by writing it directly inside the mount container:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"html\">&lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;{{ count }}&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  }\n})\n\napp.mount('#app')</pre>\n<p>Vue will automatically use the container's <code>innerHTML</code> as the template if the root component does not already have a <code>template</code> option.</p>\n<p>In-DOM templates are often used in applications that are <a href=\"../quick-start#using-vue-from-cdn\">using Vue without a build step</a>. They can also be used in conjunction with server-side frameworks, where the root template might be generated dynamically by the server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"app-configurations\" tabindex=\"-1\">App Configurations </h2>\n<p>The application instance exposes a <code>.config</code> object that allows us to configure a few app-level options, for example, defining an app-level error handler that captures errors from all descendant components:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">app.config.errorHandler = (err) =&gt; {\n  /* handle error */\n}</pre>\n<p>The application instance also provides a few methods for registering app-scoped assets. For example, registering a component:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">app.component('TodoDeleteButton', TodoDeleteButton)</pre>\n<p>This makes the <code>TodoDeleteButton</code> available for use anywhere in our app. We will discuss registration for components and other types of assets in later sections of the guide. You can also browse the full list of application instance APIs in its <a href=\"../../api/application\">API reference</a>.</p>\n<p>Make sure to apply all app configurations before mounting the app!</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-application-instances\" tabindex=\"-1\">Multiple application instances </h2>\n<p>You are not limited to a single application instance on the same page. The <code>createApp</code> API allows multiple Vue applications to co-exist on the same page, each with its own scope for configuration and global assets:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const app1 = createApp({\n  /* ... */\n})\napp1.mount('#container-1')\n\nconst app2 = createApp({\n  /* ... */\n})\napp2.mount('#container-2')</pre>\n<p>If you are using Vue to enhance server-rendered HTML and only need Vue to control specific parts of a large page, avoid mounting a single Vue application instance on the entire page. Instead, create multiple small application instances and mount them on the elements they are responsible for.</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/scaling-up/tooling":"<h1 id=\"tooling\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tooling </h1>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-online\" tabindex=\"-1\">Try It Online </h2>\n<p>You don't need to install anything on your machine to try out Vue SFCs - there are online playgrounds that allow you to do so right in the browser:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue SFC Playground</a><ul>\n<li>Always deployed from latest commit</li>\n<li>Designed for inspecting component compilation results</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://vite.new/vue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue + Vite on StackBlitz</a><ul>\n<li>IDE-like environment running actual Vite dev server in the browser</li>\n<li>Closest to local setup</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also recommended to use these online playgrounds to provide reproductions when reporting bugs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project-scaffolding\" tabindex=\"-1\">Project Scaffolding </h2>\n<h3 id=\"vite\" tabindex=\"-1\">Vite </h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vite</a> is a lightweight and fast build tool with first-class Vue SFC support.

In such cases, Vue needs to ship the template compiler to the browser in order to perform on-the-fly template compilation. On the other hand, the compiler would be unnecessary if we pre-compile the templates with a build step. To reduce client bundle size, Vue provides <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/browse/vue@3/dist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">different \"builds\"</a> optimized for different use cases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Build files that start with <code>vue.runtime.*</code> are <strong>runtime-only builds</strong>: they do not include the compiler. When using these builds, all templates must be pre-compiled via a build step.</p></li>\n<li><p>Build files that do not include <code>.runtime</code> are <strong>full builds</strong>: they include the compiler and support compiling templates directly in the browser. However, they will increase the payload by ~14kb.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our default tooling setups use the runtime-only build since all templates in SFCs are pre-compiled. If, for some reason, you need in-browser template compilation even with a build step, you can do so by configuring the build tool to alias <code>vue</code> to <code>vue/dist/vue.esm-bundler.js</code> instead.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a lighter-weight alternative for no-build-step usage, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">petite-vue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ide-support\" tabindex=\"-1\">IDE Support </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The recommended IDE setup is <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VS Code</a> + the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue - Official extension</a> (previously Volar).

Of course, you can also download this file and serve it yourself.</p>\n<p>When using Vue from a CDN, there is no \"build step\" involved. This makes the setup a lot simpler, and is suitable for enhancing static HTML or integrating with a backend framework. However, you won't be able to use the Single-File Component (SFC) syntax.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-the-global-build\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using the Global Build </h3>\n<p>The above link loads the <em>global build</em> of Vue, where all top-level APIs are exposed as properties on the global <code>Vue</code> object.

In order for ES modules to work on our local machine, we need to serve the <code>index.html</code> over the <code>http://</code> protocol, with a local HTTP server.</p>\n<p>To start a local HTTP server, first make sure you have <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Node.js</a> installed, then run <code>npx serve</code> from the command line in the same directory where your HTML file is. You can also use any other HTTP server that can serve static files with the correct MIME types.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that the imported component's template is inlined as a JavaScript string. If you are using VS Code, you can install the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">es6-string-html</a> extension and prefix the strings with a <code>/*html*/</code> comment to get syntax highlighting for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\" tabindex=\"-1\">Next Steps </h2>\n<p>If you skipped the <a href=\"introduction\">Introduction</a>, we strongly recommend reading it before moving on to the rest of the documentation.</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/essentials/template-refs":"<h1 id=\"template-refs\" tabindex=\"-1\">Template Refs </h1>\n<p>While Vue's declarative rendering model abstracts away most of the direct DOM operations for you, there may still be cases where we need direct access to the underlying DOM elements.

Any top-level properties of this object are proxied on the component instance (<code>this</code> in methods and lifecycle hooks):</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 1\n    }\n  },\n\n  // `mounted` is a lifecycle hook which we will explain later\n  mounted() {\n    // `this` refers to the component instance.\n    console.log(this.count) // =&gt; 1\n\n    // data can be mutated as well\n    this.count = 2\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpFUNFqhDAQ/JXBpzsoHu2j3B2U/oYPpnGtoetGkrW2iP/eRFsPApthd2Zndilex7H8mqioimu0wY16r4W+Rx8ULXVmYsVSC9AaNafz/gcC6RTkHwHWT6IVnne85rI+1ZLr5YJmyG1qG7gIA3Yd2R/LhN77T8y9sz1mwuyYkXazcQI2SiHz/7iP3VlQexeb5KKjEKEe2lPyMIxeSBROohqxVO4E6yV6ppL9xykTy83tOQvd7tnzoZtDwhrBO2GYNFloYWLyxrzPPOi44WWLWUt618txvASUhhRCKSHgbZt2scKy7HfCujGOqWL9BVfOgyI=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p>\n<p>These instance properties are only added when the instance is first created, so you need to ensure they are all present in the object returned by the <code>data</code> function. Where necessary, use <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code> or some other placeholder value for properties where the desired value isn't yet available.</p>\n<p>It is possible to add a new property directly to <code>this</code> without including it in <code>data</code>. However, properties added this way will not be able to trigger reactive updates.</p>\n<p>Vue uses a <code>$</code> prefix when exposing its own built-in APIs via the component instance. It also reserves the prefix <code>_</code> for internal properties. You should avoid using names for top-level <code>data</code> properties that start with either of these characters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reactive-proxy-vs-original\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reactive Proxy vs. Original </h3>\n<p>In Vue 3, data is made reactive by leveraging <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JavaScript Proxies</a>.

To explain that, we will need to briefly discuss how Vue's reactivity system works.</p>\n<p>When you use a ref in a template, and change the ref's value later, Vue automatically detects the change and updates the DOM accordingly. This is made possible with a dependency-tracking based reactivity system. When a component is rendered for the first time, Vue <strong>tracks</strong> every ref that was used during the render. Later on, when a ref is mutated, it will <strong>trigger</strong> a re-render for components that are tracking it.</p>\n<p>In standard JavaScript, there is no way to detect the access or mutation of plain variables. However, we can intercept the get and set operations of an object's properties using getter and setter methods.</p>\n<p>The <code>.value</code> property gives Vue the opportunity to detect when a ref has been accessed or mutated. Under the hood, Vue performs the tracking in its getter, and performs triggering in its setter. Conceptually, you can think of a ref as an object that looks like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// pseudo code, not actual implementation\nconst myRef = {\n  _value: 0,\n  get value() {\n    track()\n    return this._value\n  },\n  set value(newValue) {\n    this._value = newValue\n    trigger()\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Another nice trait of refs is that unlike plain variables, you can pass refs into functions while retaining access to the latest value and the reactivity connection. This is particularly useful when refactoring complex logic into reusable code.</p>\n<p>The reactivity system is discussed in more details in the <a href=\"../extras/reactivity-in-depth\">Reactivity in Depth</a> section.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<h2 id=\"declaring-methods\" tabindex=\"-1\">Declaring Methods </h2>\n<p>To add methods to a component instance we use the <code>methods</code> option. This should be an object containing the desired methods:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    increment() {\n      this.count++\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    // methods can be called in lifecycle hooks, or other methods!\n    this.increment()\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Vue automatically binds the <code>this</code> value for <code>methods</code> so that it always refers to the component instance. This ensures that a method retains the correct <code>this</code> value if it's used as an event listener or callback. You should avoid using arrow functions when defining <code>methods</code>, as that prevents Vue from binding the appropriate <code>this</code> value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  methods: {\n    increment: () =&gt; {\n      // BAD: no `this` access here!\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Just like all other properties of the component instance, the <code>methods</code> are accessible from within the component's template.

For shallow refs, only <code>.value</code> access is tracked for reactivity. Shallow refs can be used for optimizing performance by avoiding the observation cost of large objects, or in cases where the inner state is managed by an external library.</p>\n<p>Further reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../best-practices/performance#reduce-reactivity-overhead-for-large-immutable-structures\">Reduce Reactivity Overhead for Large Immutable Structures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../extras/reactivity-in-depth#integration-with-external-state-systems\">Integration with External State Systems</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"dom-update-timing\" tabindex=\"-1\">DOM Update Timing </h3>\n<p>When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the \"next tick\" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.</p>\n<p>To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the <a href=\"../../api/general#nexttick\">nextTick()</a> global API:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">import { nextTick } from 'vue'\n\nasync function increment() {\n  count.value++\n  await nextTick()\n  // Now the DOM is updated\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">import { nextTick } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    async increment() {\n      this.count++\n      await nextTick()\n      // Now the DOM is updated\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<h2 id=\"reactive\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<code>reactive()</code> </h2>\n<p>There is another way to declare reactive state, with the <code>reactive()</code> API. Unlike a ref which wraps the inner value in a special object, <code>reactive()</code> makes an object itself reactive:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { reactive } from 'vue'\n\nconst state = reactive({ count: 0 })</pre>\n<blockquote><p>See also: <a href=\"../typescript/composition-api#typing-reactive\">Typing Reactive</a> </p></blockquote>\n<p>Usage in template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;button @click=\"state.count++\"&gt;\n  {{ state.count }}\n&lt;/button&gt;</pre>\n<p>Reactive objects are <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JavaScript Proxies</a> and behave just like normal objects. The difference is that Vue is able to intercept the access and mutation of all properties of a reactive object for reactivity tracking and triggering.</p>\n<p><code>reactive()</code> converts the object deeply: nested objects are also wrapped with <code>reactive()</code> when accessed. It is also called by <code>ref()</code> internally when the ref value is an object. Similar to shallow refs, there is also the <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive\"><code>shallowReactive()</code></a> API for opting-out of deep reactivity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reactive-proxy-vs-original-1\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reactive Proxy vs. Original </h3>\n<p>It is important to note that the returned value from <code>reactive()</code> is a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Proxy</a> of the original object, which is not equal to the original object:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const raw = {}\nconst proxy = reactive(raw)\n\n// proxy is NOT equal to the original.\nconsole.log(proxy === raw) // false</pre>\n<p>Only the proxy is reactive - mutating the original object will not trigger updates. Therefore, the best practice when working with Vue's reactivity system is to <strong>exclusively use the proxied versions of your state</strong>.</p>\n<p>To ensure consistent access to the proxy, calling <code>reactive()</code> on the same object always returns the same proxy, and calling <code>reactive()</code> on an existing proxy also returns that same proxy:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// calling reactive() on the same object returns the same proxy\nconsole.log(reactive(raw) === proxy) // true\n\n// calling reactive() on a proxy returns itself\nconsole.log(reactive(proxy) === proxy) // true</pre>\n<p>This rule applies to nested objects as well. Due to deep reactivity, nested objects inside a reactive object are also proxies:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const proxy = reactive({})\n\nconst raw = {}\nproxy.nested = raw\n\nconsole.log(proxy.nested === raw) // false</pre>\n<h3 id=\"limitations-of-reactive\" tabindex=\"-1\">Limitations of <code>reactive()</code> </h3>\n<p>The <code>reactive()</code> API has a few limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Limited value types:</strong> it only works for object types (objects, arrays, and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects#keyed_collections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">collection types</a> such as <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code>).

This means we can't easily \"replace\" a reactive object because the reactivity connection to the first reference is lost:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">let state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n\n// the above reference ({ count: 0 }) is no longer being tracked\n// (reactivity connection is lost!)\nstate = reactive({ count: 1 })</pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Not destructure-friendly:</strong> when we destructure a reactive object's primitive type property into local variables, or when we pass that property into a function, we will lose the reactivity connection:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const state = reactive({ count: 0 })\n\n// count is disconnected from state.count when destructured.\nlet { count } = state\n// does not affect original state\ncount++\n\n// the function receives a plain number and\n// won't be able to track changes to state.count\n// we have to pass the entire object in to retain reactivity\ncallSomeFunction(state.count)</pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Due to these limitations, we recommend using <code>ref()</code> as the primary API for declaring reactive state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"additional-ref-unwrapping-details\" tabindex=\"-1\">Additional Ref Unwrapping Details </h2>\n<h3 id=\"ref-unwrapping-as-reactive-object-property\" tabindex=\"-1\">As Reactive Object Property </h3>\n<p>A ref is automatically unwrapped when accessed or mutated as a property of a reactive object.

Putting too much logic in your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain. For example, if we have an object with a nested array:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      author: {\n        name: 'John Doe',\n        books: [\n          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',\n          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',\n          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const author = reactive({\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  books: [\n    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',\n    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',\n    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'\n  ]\n})</pre></div>\n<p>And we want to display different messages depending on if <code>author</code> already has some books or not:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;p&gt;Has published books:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;{{ author.books.length &gt; 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}&lt;/span&gt;</pre>\n<p>At this point, the template is getting a bit cluttered. We have to look at it for a second before realizing that it performs a calculation depending on <code>author.books</code>. More importantly, we probably don't want to repeat ourselves if we need to include this calculation in the template more than once.</p>\n<p>That's why for complex logic that includes reactive data, it is recommended to use a <strong>computed property</strong>. Here's the same example, refactored:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      author: {\n        name: 'John Doe',\n        books: [\n          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',\n          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',\n          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    // a computed getter\n    publishedBooksMessage() {\n      // `this` points to the component instance\n      return this.author.books.length &gt; 0 ?

The <code>computed()</code> function expects to be passed a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get#description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">getter function</a>, and the returned value is a <strong>computed ref</strong>. Similar to normal refs, you can access the computed result as <code>publishedBooksMessage.value</code>. Computed refs are also auto-unwrapped in templates so you can reference them without <code>.value</code> in template expressions.</p>\n<p>A computed property automatically tracks its reactive dependencies. Vue is aware that the computation of <code>publishedBooksMessage</code> depends on <code>author.books</code>, so it will update any bindings that depend on <code>publishedBooksMessage</code> when <code>author.books</code> changes.</p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"../typescript/composition-api#typing-computed\">Typing Computed</a> </p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"computed-caching-vs-methods\" tabindex=\"-1\">Computed Caching vs. Methods </h2>\n<p>You may have noticed we can achieve the same result by invoking a method in the expression:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;p&gt;{{ calculateBooksMessage() }}&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">// in component\nmethods: {\n  calculateBooksMessage() {\n    return this.author.books.length &gt; 0 ?

'Yes' : 'No'\n}</pre></div>\n<p>Instead of a computed property, we can define the same function as a method. For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly the same. However, the difference is that <strong>computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies.</strong> A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. This means as long as <code>author.books</code> has not changed, multiple access to <code>publishedBooksMessage</code> will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the getter function again.</p>\n<p>This also means the following computed property will never update, because <code>Date.now()</code> is not a reactive dependency:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">computed: {\n  now() {\n    return Date.now()\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const now = computed(() =&gt; Date.now())</pre></div>\n<p>In comparison, a method invocation will <strong>always</strong> run the function whenever a re-render happens.</p>\n<p>Why do we need caching? Imagine we have an expensive computed property <code>list</code>, which requires looping through a huge array and doing a lot of computations. Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on <code>list</code>. Without caching, we would be executing <code>list</code>’s getter many more times than necessary! In cases where you do not want caching, use a method call instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writable-computed\" tabindex=\"-1\">Writable Computed </h2>\n<p>Computed properties are by default getter-only. If you attempt to assign a new value to a computed property, you will receive a runtime warning. In the rare cases where you need a \"writable\" computed property, you can create one by providing both a getter and a setter:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      firstName: 'John',\n      lastName: 'Doe'\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    fullName: {\n      // getter\n      get() {\n        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName\n      },\n      // setter\n      set(newValue) {\n        // Note: we are using destructuring assignment syntax here.\n        [this.firstName, this.lastName] = newValue.split(' ')\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Now when you run <code>this.fullName = 'John Doe'</code>, the setter will be invoked and <code>this.firstName</code> and <code>this.lastName</code> will be updated accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst firstName = ref('John')\nconst lastName = ref('Doe')\n\nconst fullName = computed({\n  // getter\n  get() {\n    return firstName.value + ' ' + lastName.value\n  },\n  // setter\n  set(newValue) {\n    // Note: we are using destructuring assignment syntax here.\n    [firstName.value, lastName.value] = newValue.split(' ')\n  }\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>Now when you run <code>fullName.value = 'John Doe'</code>, the setter will be invoked and <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> will be updated accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"previous\" tabindex=\"-1\">Getting the Previous Value </h2>\n<ul><li>Only supported in 3.4+</li></ul>\n<p class=\"options-api\"> In case you need it, you can get the previous value returned by the computed property accessing the second argument of the getter: </p>\n<p class=\"composition-api\"> In case you need it, you can get the previous value returned by the computed property accessing the first argument of the getter: </p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 2\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    // This computed will return the value of count when it's less or equal to 3.\n    // When count is &gt;=4, the last value that fulfilled our condition will be returned\n    // instead until count is less or equal to 3\n    alwaysSmall(_, previous) {\n      if (this.count &lt;= 3) {\n        return this.count\n      }\n\n      return previous\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(2)\n\n// This computed will return the value of count when it's less or equal to 3.\n// When count is &gt;=4, the last value that fulfilled our condition will be returned\n// instead until count is less or equal to 3\nconst alwaysSmall = computed((previous) =&gt; {\n  if (count.value &lt;= 3) {\n    return count.value\n  }\n\n  return previous\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>\n<p>In case you're using a writable computed:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 2\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    alwaysSmall: {\n      get(_, previous) {\n        if (this.count &lt;= 3) {\n          return this.count\n        }\n\n        return previous;\n      },\n      set(newValue) {\n        this.count = newValue * 2\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(2)\n\nconst alwaysSmall = computed({\n  get(previous) {\n    if (count.value &lt;= 3) {\n      return count.value\n    }\n\n    return previous\n  },\n  set(newValue) {\n    count.value = newValue * 2\n  }\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"best-practices\" tabindex=\"-1\">Best Practices </h2>\n<h3 id=\"getters-should-be-side-effect-free\" tabindex=\"-1\">Getters should be side-effect free </h3>\n<p>It is important to remember that computed getter functions should only perform pure computation and be free of side effects. For example, <strong>don't mutate other state, make async requests, or mutate the DOM inside a computed getter!</strong> Think of a computed property as declaratively describing how to derive a value based on other values - its only responsibility should be computing and returning that value. Later in the guide we will discuss how we can perform side effects in reaction to state changes with <a href=\"watchers\">watchers</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"avoid-mutating-computed-value\" tabindex=\"-1\">Avoid mutating computed value </h3>\n<p>The returned value from a computed property is derived state. Think of it as a temporary snapshot - every time the source state changes, a new snapshot is created. It does not make sense to mutate a snapshot, so a computed return value should be treated as read-only and never be mutated - instead, update the source state it depends on to trigger new computations.</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/essentials/event-handling":"<h1 id=\"event-handling\" tabindex=\"-1\">Event Handling </h1>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"listening-to-events\" tabindex=\"-1\">Listening to Events </h2>\n<p>We can use the <code>v-on</code> directive, which we typically shorten to the <code>@</code> symbol, to listen to DOM events and run some JavaScript when they're triggered.

Vue allows adding key modifiers for <code>v-on</code> or <code>@</code> when listening for key events:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- only call `submit` when the `key` is `Enter` --&gt;\n&lt;input @keyup.enter=\"submit\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>You can directly use any valid key names exposed via <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>KeyboardEvent.key</code></a> as modifiers by converting them to kebab-case.</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;input @keyup.page-down=\"onPageDown\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>In the above example, the handler will only be called if <code>$event.key</code> is equal to <code>'PageDown'</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"key-aliases\" tabindex=\"-1\">Key Aliases </h3>\n<p>Vue provides aliases for the most commonly used keys:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.enter</code></li>\n<li><code>.tab</code></li>\n<li>\n<code>.delete</code> (captures both \"Delete\" and \"Backspace\" keys)</li>\n<li><code>.esc</code></li>\n<li><code>.space</code></li>\n<li><code>.up</code></li>\n<li><code>.down</code></li>\n<li><code>.left</code></li>\n<li><code>.right</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"system-modifier-keys\" tabindex=\"-1\">System Modifier Keys </h3>\n<p>You can use the following modifiers to trigger mouse or keyboard event listeners only when the corresponding modifier key is pressed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.ctrl</code></li>\n<li><code>.alt</code></li>\n<li><code>.shift</code></li>\n<li><code>.meta</code></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Note</strong><p>On Macintosh keyboards, meta is the command key (⌘).

So that for a left-handed mouse layout the \"main\" button might physically be the right one but would trigger the <code>.left</code> modifier handler. Or a trackpad might trigger the <code>.left</code> handler with a one-finger tap, the <code>.right</code> handler with a two-finger tap, and the <code>.middle</code> handler with a three-finger tap.

Along the way, it also runs functions called lifecycle hooks, giving users the opportunity to add their own code at specific stages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"registering-lifecycle-hooks\" tabindex=\"-1\">Registering Lifecycle Hooks </h2>\n<p>For example, the <span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onMounted</code></span><span class=\"options-api\"><code>mounted</code></span> hook can be used to run code after the component has finished the initial rendering and created the DOM nodes:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { onMounted } from 'vue'\n\nonMounted(() =&gt; {\n  console.log(`the component is now mounted.`)\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  mounted() {\n    console.log(`the component is now mounted.`)\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<p>There are also other hooks which will be called at different stages of the instance's lifecycle, with the most commonly used being <span class=\"composition-api\"><a href=\"../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onmounted\"><code>onMounted</code></a>, <a href=\"../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onupdated\"><code>onUpdated</code></a>, and <a href=\"../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onunmounted\"><code>onUnmounted</code></a>.</span><span class=\"options-api\"><a href=\"../../api/options-lifecycle#mounted\"><code>mounted</code></a>, <a href=\"../../api/options-lifecycle#updated\"><code>updated</code></a>, and <a href=\"../../api/options-lifecycle#unmounted\"><code>unmounted</code></a>.</span></p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p>All lifecycle hooks are called with their <code>this</code> context pointing to the current active instance invoking it. Note this means you should avoid using arrow functions when declaring lifecycle hooks, as you won't be able to access the component instance via <code>this</code> if you do so.</p></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>When calling <code>onMounted</code>, Vue automatically associates the registered callback function with the current active component instance. This requires these hooks to be registered <strong>synchronously</strong> during component setup. For example, do not do this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  onMounted(() =&gt; {\n    // this won't work.\n  })\n}, 100)</pre>\n<p>Do note this doesn't mean that the call must be placed lexically inside <code>setup()</code> or <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>. <code>onMounted()</code> can be called in an external function as long as the call stack is synchronous and originates from within <code>setup()</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"lifecycle-diagram\" tabindex=\"-1\">Lifecycle Diagram </h2>\n<p>Below is a diagram for the instance lifecycle.

All Vue templates are syntactically valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers.</p>\n<p>Under the hood, Vue compiles the templates into highly-optimized JavaScript code. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue can intelligently figure out the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes.</p>\n<p>If you are familiar with Virtual DOM concepts and prefer the raw power of JavaScript, you can also <a href=\"../extras/render-function\">directly write render functions</a> instead of templates, with optional JSX support. However, do note that they do not enjoy the same level of compile-time optimizations as templates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"text-interpolation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Text Interpolation </h2>\n<p>The most basic form of data binding is text interpolation using the \"Mustache\" syntax (double curly braces):</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;span&gt;Message: {{ msg }}&lt;/span&gt;</pre>\n<p>The mustache tag will be replaced with the value of the <code>msg</code> property <a href=\"reactivity-fundamentals#declaring-reactive-state\">from the corresponding component instance</a>. It will also be updated whenever the <code>msg</code> property changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"raw-html\" tabindex=\"-1\">Raw HTML </h2>\n<p>The double mustaches interpret the data as plain text, not HTML. In order to output real HTML, you will need to use the <a href=\"../../api/built-in-directives#v-html\"><code>v-html</code> directive</a>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;p&gt;Using text interpolation: {{ rawHtml }}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Using v-html directive: &lt;span v-html=\"rawHtml\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>Here we're encountering something new. The <code>v-html</code> attribute you're seeing is called a <strong>directive</strong>. Directives are prefixed with <code>v-</code> to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, we're basically saying \"keep this element's inner HTML up-to-date with the <code>rawHtml</code> property on the current active instance.\"</p>\n<p>The contents of the <code>span</code> will be replaced with the value of the <code>rawHtml</code> property, interpreted as plain HTML - data bindings are ignored. Note that you cannot use <code>v-html</code> to compose template partials, because Vue is not a string-based templating engine. Instead, components are preferred as the fundamental unit for UI reuse and composition.</p>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Security Warning</strong><p>Dynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous because it can easily lead to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">XSS vulnerabilities</a>.

Instead, use a <a href=\"../../api/built-in-directives#v-bind\"><code>v-bind</code> directive</a>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div v-bind:id=\"dynamicId\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>The <code>v-bind</code> directive instructs Vue to keep the element's <code>id</code> attribute in sync with the component's <code>dynamicId</code> property. If the bound value is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, then the attribute will be removed from the rendered element.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shorthand\" tabindex=\"-1\">Shorthand </h3>\n<p>Because <code>v-bind</code> is so commonly used, it has a dedicated shorthand syntax:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div :id=\"dynamicId\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>Attributes that start with <code>:</code> may look a bit different from normal HTML, but it is in fact a valid character for attribute names and all Vue-supported browsers can parse it correctly. In addition, they do not appear in the final rendered markup. The shorthand syntax is optional, but you will likely appreciate it when you learn more about its usage later.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For the rest of the guide, we will be using the shorthand syntax in code examples, as that's the most common usage for Vue developers.</p></blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"same-name-shorthand\" tabindex=\"-1\">Same-name Shorthand </h3>\n<ul><li>Only supported in 3.4+</li></ul>\n<p>If the attribute has the same name as the variable name of the JavaScript value being bound, the syntax can be further shortened to omit the attribute value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- same as :id=\"id\" --&gt;\n&lt;div :id&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- this also works --&gt;\n&lt;div v-bind:id&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>This is similar to the property shorthand syntax when declaring objects in JavaScript.

But Vue actually supports the full power of JavaScript expressions inside all data bindings:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">{{ number + 1 }}\n\n{{ ok ? 'YES' : 'NO' }}\n\n{{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}\n\n&lt;div :id=\"`list-${id}`\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>These expressions will be evaluated as JavaScript in the data scope of the current component instance.</p>\n<p>In Vue templates, JavaScript expressions can be used in the following positions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inside text interpolations (mustaches)</li>\n<li>In the attribute value of any Vue directives (special attributes that start with <code>v-</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"expressions-only\" tabindex=\"-1\">Expressions Only </h3>\n<p>Each binding can only contain <strong>one single expression</strong>. An expression is a piece of code that can be evaluated to a value. A simple check is whether it can be used after <code>return</code>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the following will <strong>NOT</strong> work:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- this is a statement, not an expression: --&gt;\n{{ var a = 1 }}\n\n&lt;!-- flow control won't work either, use ternary expressions --&gt;\n{{ if (ok) { return message } }}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"calling-functions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Calling Functions </h3>\n<p>It is possible to call a component-exposed method inside a binding expression:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;time :title=\"toTitleDate(date)\" :datetime=\"date\"&gt;\n  {{ formatDate(date) }}\n&lt;/time&gt;</pre>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Functions called inside binding expressions will be called every time the component updates, so they should <strong>not</strong> have any side effects, such as changing data or triggering asynchronous operations.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"restricted-globals-access\" tabindex=\"-1\">Restricted Globals Access </h3>\n<p>Template expressions are sandboxed and only have access to a <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/shared/src/globalsAllowList.ts#L3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">restricted list of globals</a>. The list exposes commonly used built-in globals such as <code>Math</code> and <code>Date</code>.</p>\n<p>Globals not explicitly included in the list, for example user-attached properties on <code>window</code>, will not be accessible in template expressions. You can, however, explicitly define additional globals for all Vue expressions by adding them to <a href=\"../../api/application#app-config-globalproperties\"><code>app.config.globalProperties</code></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directives\" tabindex=\"-1\">Directives </h2>\n<p>Directives are special attributes with the <code>v-</code> prefix. Vue provides a number of <a href=\"../../api/built-in-directives\">built-in directives</a>, including <code>v-html</code> and <code>v-bind</code> which we have introduced above.</p>\n<p>Directive attribute values are expected to be single JavaScript expressions (with the exception of <code>v-for</code>, <code>v-on</code> and <code>v-slot</code>, which will be discussed in their respective sections later). A directive's job is to reactively apply updates to the DOM when the value of its expression changes. Take <a href=\"../../api/built-in-directives#v-if\"><code>v-if</code></a> as an example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;p v-if=\"seen\"&gt;Now you see me&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>Here, the <code>v-if</code> directive would remove or insert the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element based on the truthiness of the value of the expression <code>seen</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"arguments\" tabindex=\"-1\">Arguments </h3>\n<p>Some directives can take an \"argument\", denoted by a colon after the directive name. For example, the <code>v-bind</code> directive is used to reactively update an HTML attribute:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;a v-bind:href=\"url\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- shorthand --&gt;\n&lt;a :href=\"url\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>Here, <code>href</code> is the argument, which tells the <code>v-bind</code> directive to bind the element's <code>href</code> attribute to the value of the expression <code>url</code>. In the shorthand, everything before the argument (i.e., <code>v-bind:</code>) is condensed into a single character, <code>:</code>.</p>\n<p>Another example is the <code>v-on</code> directive, which listens to DOM events:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;a v-on:click=\"doSomething\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- shorthand --&gt;\n&lt;a @click=\"doSomething\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>Here, the argument is the event name to listen to: <code>click</code>. <code>v-on</code> has a corresponding shorthand, namely the <code>@</code> character. We will talk about event handling in more detail too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-arguments\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dynamic Arguments </h3>\n<p>It is also possible to use a JavaScript expression in a directive argument by wrapping it with square brackets:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!--\nNote that there are some constraints to the argument expression,\nas explained in the \"Dynamic Argument Value Constraints\" and \"Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints\" sections below.\n--&gt;\n&lt;a v-bind:[attributeName]=\"url\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- shorthand --&gt;\n&lt;a :[attributeName]=\"url\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>Here, <code>attributeName</code> will be dynamically evaluated as a JavaScript expression, and its evaluated value will be used as the final value for the argument. For example, if your component instance has a data property, <code>attributeName</code>, whose value is <code>\"href\"</code>, then this binding will be equivalent to <code>v-bind:href</code>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you can use dynamic arguments to bind a handler to a dynamic event name:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;a v-on:[eventName]=\"doSomething\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- shorthand --&gt;\n&lt;a @[eventName]=\"doSomething\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>In this example, when <code>eventName</code>'s value is <code>\"focus\"</code>, <code>v-on:[eventName]</code> will be equivalent to <code>v-on:focus</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dynamic-argument-value-constraints\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dynamic Argument Value Constraints </h4>\n<p>Dynamic arguments are expected to evaluate to a string, with the exception of <code>null</code>. The special value <code>null</code> can be used to explicitly remove the binding. Any other non-string value will trigger a warning.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dynamic-argument-syntax-constraints\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dynamic Argument Syntax Constraints </h4>\n<p>Dynamic argument expressions have some syntax constraints because certain characters, such as spaces and quotes, are invalid inside HTML attribute names. For example, the following is invalid:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- This will trigger a compiler warning. --&gt;\n&lt;a :['foo' + bar]=\"value\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>If you need to pass a complex dynamic argument, it's probably better to use a <a href=\"computed\">computed property</a>, which we will cover shortly.</p>\n<p>When using in-DOM templates (templates directly written in an HTML file), you should also avoid naming keys with uppercase characters, as browsers will coerce attribute names into lowercase:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;a :[someAttr]=\"value\"&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>The above will be converted to <code>:[someattr]</code> in in-DOM templates. If your component has a <code>someAttr</code> property instead of <code>someattr</code>, your code won't work. Templates inside Single-File Components are <strong>not</strong> subject to this constraint.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modifiers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Modifiers </h3>\n<p>Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. For example, the <code>.prevent</code> modifier tells the <code>v-on</code> directive to call <code>event.preventDefault()</code> on the triggered event:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;form

</p>\n</div>\n","guide/essentials/class-and-style":"<h1 id=\"class-and-style-bindings\" tabindex=\"-1\">Class and Style Bindings </h1>\n<p>A common need for data binding is manipulating an element's class list and inline styles. Since <code>class</code> and <code>style</code> are both attributes, we can use <code>v-bind</code> to assign them a string value dynamically, much like with other attributes. However, trying to generate those values using string concatenation can be annoying and error-prone. For this reason, Vue provides special enhancements when <code>v-bind</code> is used with <code>class</code> and <code>style</code>. In addition to strings, the expressions can also evaluate to objects or arrays.</p>\n<h2 id=\"binding-html-classes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Binding HTML Classes </h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"binding-to-objects\" tabindex=\"-1\">Binding to Objects </h3>\n<p>We can pass an object to <code>:class</code> (short for <code>v-bind:class</code>) to dynamically toggle classes:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div :class=\"{ active: isActive }\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>The above syntax means the presence of the <code>active</code> class will be determined by the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">truthiness</a> of the data property <code>isActive</code>.</p>\n<p>You can have multiple classes toggled by having more fields in the object. In addition, the <code>:class</code> directive can also co-exist with the plain <code>class</code> attribute. So given the following state:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const isActive = ref(true)\nconst hasError = ref(false)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">data() {\n  return {\n    isActive: true,\n    hasError: false\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<p>And the following template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div\n  class=\"static\"\n  :class=\"{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }\"\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>It will render:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div class=\"static active\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>When <code>isActive</code> or <code>hasError</code> changes, the class list will be updated accordingly. For example, if <code>hasError</code> becomes <code>true</code>, the class list will become <code>\"static active text-danger\"</code>.</p>\n<p>The bound object doesn't have to be inline:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const classObject = reactive({\n  active: true,\n  'text-danger': false\n})</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">data() {\n  return {\n    classObject: {\n      active: true,\n      'text-danger': false\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div :class=\"classObject\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>This will render:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div class=\"active\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>We can also bind to a <a href=\"computed\">computed property</a> that returns an object. This is a common and powerful pattern:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const isActive = ref(true)\nconst error = ref(null)\n\nconst classObject = computed(() =&gt; ({\n  active: isActive.value &amp;&amp; !error.value,\n  'text-danger': error.value &amp;&amp; error.value.type === 'fatal'\n}))</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">data() {\n  return {\n    isActive: true,\n    error: null\n  }\n},\ncomputed: {\n  classObject() {\n    return {\n      active: this.isActive &amp;&amp; !this.error,\n      'text-danger': this.error &amp;&amp; this.error.type === 'fatal'\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div :class=\"classObject\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"binding-to-arrays\" tabindex=\"-1\">Binding to Arrays </h3>\n<p>We can bind <code>:class</code> to an array to apply a list of classes:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const activeClass = ref('active')\nconst errorClass = ref('text-danger')</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">data() {\n  return {\n    activeClass: 'active',\n    errorClass: 'text-danger'\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div :class=\"[activeClass, errorClass]\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>Which will render:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div class=\"active text-danger\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>If you would like to also toggle a class in the list conditionally, you can do it with a ternary expression:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div :class=\"[isActive ? activeClass : '', errorClass]\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>This will always apply <code>errorClass</code>, but <code>activeClass</code> will only be applied when <code>isActive</code> is truthy.</p>\n<p>However, this can be a bit verbose if you have multiple conditional classes.

Read that first if you are new to components.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A Vue component needs to be \"registered\" so that Vue knows where to locate its implementation when it is encountered in a template. There are two ways to register components: global and local.</p>\n<h2 id=\"global-registration\" tabindex=\"-1\">Global Registration </h2>\n<p>We can make components available globally in the current <a href=\"../essentials/application\">Vue application</a> using the <code>.component()</code> method:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({})\n\napp.component(\n  // the registered name\n  'MyComponent',\n  // the implementation\n  {\n    /* ... */\n  }\n)</pre>\n<p>If using SFCs, you will be registering the imported <code>.vue</code> files:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import MyComponent from './App.vue'\n\napp.component('MyComponent', MyComponent)</pre>\n<p>The <code>.component()</code> method can be chained:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">app\n  .component('ComponentA', ComponentA)\n  .component('ComponentB', ComponentB)\n  .component('ComponentC', ComponentC)</pre>\n<p>Globally registered components can be used in the template of any component within this application:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- this will work in any component inside the app --&gt;\n&lt;ComponentA/&gt;\n&lt;ComponentB/&gt;\n&lt;ComponentC/&gt;</pre>\n<p>This even applies to all subcomponents, meaning all three of these components will also be available <em>inside each other</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"local-registration\" tabindex=\"-1\">Local Registration </h2>\n<p>While convenient, global registration has a few drawbacks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Global registration prevents build systems from removing unused components (a.k.a \"tree-shaking\"). If you globally register a component but end up not using it anywhere in your app, it will still be included in the final bundle.</p></li>\n<li><p>Global registration makes dependency relationships less explicit in large applications. It makes it difficult to locate a child component's implementation from a parent component using it. This can affect long-term maintainability similar to using too many global variables.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Local registration scopes the availability of the registered components to the current component only. It makes the dependency relationship more explicit, and is more tree-shaking friendly.</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>When using SFC with <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, imported components can be locally used without registration:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;ComponentA /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>In non-<code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, you will need to use the <code>components</code> option:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import ComponentA from './ComponentA.js'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ComponentA\n  },\n  setup() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<p>Local registration is done using the <code>components</code> option:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ComponentA\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;ComponentA /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p>For each property in the <code>components</code> object, the key will be the registered name of the component, while the value will contain the implementation of the component. The above example is using the ES2015 property shorthand and is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  components: {\n    ComponentA: ComponentA\n  }\n  // ...\n}</pre>\n<p>Note that <strong>locally registered components are <em>not</em> also available in descendant components</strong>. In this case, <code>ComponentA</code> will be made available to the current component only, not any of its child or descendant components.</p>\n<h2 id=\"component-name-casing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Component Name Casing </h2>\n<p>Throughout the guide, we are using PascalCase names when registering components. This is because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>PascalCase names are valid JavaScript identifiers. This makes it easier to import and register components in JavaScript. It also helps IDEs with auto-completion.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>&lt;PascalCase /&gt;</code> makes it more obvious that this is a Vue component instead of a native HTML element in templates. It also differentiates Vue components from custom elements (web components).</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the recommended style when working with SFC or string templates. However, as discussed in <a href=\"../essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats\">in-DOM Template Parsing Caveats</a>, PascalCase tags are not usable in in-DOM templates.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Vue supports resolving kebab-case tags to components registered using PascalCase. This means a component registered as <code>MyComponent</code> can be referenced inside a Vue template (or inside an HTML element rendered by Vue) via both <code>&lt;MyComponent&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;my-component&gt;</code>. This allows us to use the same JavaScript component registration code regardless of template source.</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/components/registration\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/components/registration</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/components/events":"<h1 id=\"component-events\" tabindex=\"-1\">Component Events </h1>\n<blockquote><p>This page assumes you've already read the <a href=\"../essentials/component-basics\">Components Basics</a>.

Notice we emitted a camelCase event, but can listen for it using a kebab-cased listener in the parent. As with <a href=\"props#prop-name-casing\">props casing</a>, we recommend using kebab-cased event listeners in templates.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Unlike native DOM events, component emitted events do <strong>not</strong> bubble. You can only listen to the events emitted by a direct child component. If there is a need to communicate between sibling or deeply nested components, use an external event bus or a <a href=\"../scaling-up/state-management\">global state management solution</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"event-arguments\" tabindex=\"-1\">Event Arguments </h2>\n<p>It's sometimes useful to emit a specific value with an event. For example, we may want the <code>&lt;BlogPost&gt;</code> component to be in charge of how much to enlarge the text by. In those cases, we can pass extra arguments to <code>$emit</code> to provide this value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;button @click=\"$emit('increaseBy', 1)\"&gt;\n  Increase by 1\n&lt;/button&gt;</pre>\n<p>Then, when we listen to the event in the parent, we can use an inline arrow function as the listener, which allows us to access the event argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;MyButton @increase-by=\"(n) =&gt; count += n\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>Or, if the event handler is a method:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;MyButton @increase-by=\"increaseCount\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>Then the value will be passed as the first parameter of that method:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">methods: {\n  increaseCount(n) {\n    this.count += n\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">function increaseCount(n) {\n  count.value += n\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>All extra arguments passed to <code>$emit()</code> after the event name will be forwarded to the listener.

Do not use objects as <code>v-for</code> keys.

These mutation methods are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>push()</code></li>\n<li><code>pop()</code></li>\n<li><code>shift()</code></li>\n<li><code>unshift()</code></li>\n<li><code>splice()</code></li>\n<li><code>sort()</code></li>\n<li><code>reverse()</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"replacing-an-array\" tabindex=\"-1\">Replacing an Array </h3>\n<p>Mutation methods, as the name suggests, mutate the original array they are called on. In comparison, there are also non-mutating methods, e.g. <code>filter()</code>, <code>concat()</code> and <code>slice()</code>, which do not mutate the original array but <strong>always return a new array</strong>. When working with non-mutating methods, we should replace the old array with the new one:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">// `items` is a ref with array value\nitems.value = items.value.filter((item) =&gt; item.message.match(/Foo/))</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">this.items = this.items.filter((item) =&gt; item.message.match(/Foo/))</pre></div>\n<p>You might think this will cause Vue to throw away the existing DOM and re-render the entire list - luckily, that is not the case. Vue implements some smart heuristics to maximize DOM element reuse, so replacing an array with another array containing overlapping objects is a very efficient operation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"displaying-filtered-sorted-results\" tabindex=\"-1\">Displaying Filtered/Sorted Results </h2>\n<p>Sometimes we want to display a filtered or sorted version of an array without actually mutating or resetting the original data. In this case, you can create a computed property that returns the filtered or sorted array.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const numbers = ref([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\nconst evenNumbers = computed(() =&gt; {\n  return numbers.value.filter((n) =&gt; n % 2 === 0)\n})</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">data() {\n  return {\n    numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n  }\n},\ncomputed: {\n  evenNumbers() {\n    return this.numbers.filter(n =&gt; n % 2 === 0)\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;li v-for=\"n in evenNumbers\"&gt;{{ n }}&lt;/li&gt;</pre>\n<p>In situations where computed properties are not feasible (e.g. inside nested <code>v-for</code> loops), you can use a method:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const sets = ref([\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n])\n\nfunction even(numbers) {\n  return numbers.filter((number) =&gt; number % 2 === 0)\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">data() {\n  return {\n    sets: [[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]\n  }\n},\nmethods: {\n  even(numbers) {\n    return numbers.filter(number =&gt; number % 2 === 0)\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;ul v-for=\"numbers in sets\"&gt;\n  &lt;li v-for=\"n in even(numbers)\"&gt;{{ n }}&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>\n<p>Be careful with <code>reverse()</code> and <code>sort()</code> in a computed property! These two methods will mutate the original array, which should be avoided in computed getters. Create a copy of the original array before calling these methods:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"diff\">- return numbers.reverse()\n+ return [...numbers].reverse()</pre><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/essentials/forms":"<h1 id=\"form-input-bindings\" tabindex=\"-1\">Form Input Bindings </h1>\n\n\n<p>When dealing with forms on the frontend, we often need to sync the state of form input elements with corresponding state in JavaScript.

We will discuss more details about <a href=\"#prop-validation\">prop validation</a> further down this page.</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p>See also: <a href=\"../typescript/options-api#typing-component-props\">Typing Component Props</a> </p></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>If you are using TypeScript with <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, it's also possible to declare props using pure type annotations:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\ndefineProps&lt;{\n  title?: string\n  likes?: number\n}&gt;()\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>More details: <a href=\"../typescript/composition-api#typing-component-props\">Typing Component Props</a> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<h2 id=\"reactive-props-destructure\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reactive Props Destructure  </h2>\n<p>Vue's reactivity system tracks state usage based on property access. E.g. when you access <code>props.foo</code> in a computed getter or a watcher, the <code>foo</code> prop gets tracked as a dependency.</p>\n<p>So, given the following code:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const { foo } = defineProps(['foo'])\n\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; {\n  // runs only once before 3.5\n  // re-runs when the \"foo\" prop changes in 3.5+\n  console.log(foo)\n})</pre>\n<p>In version 3.4 and below, <code>foo</code> is an actual constant and will never change. In version 3.5 and above, Vue's compiler automatically prepends <code>props.</code> when code in the same <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> block accesses variables destructured from <code>defineProps</code>. Therefore the code above becomes equivalent to the following:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const props = defineProps(['foo'])\n\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; {\n  // `foo` transformed to `props.foo` by the compiler\n  console.log(props.foo)\n})</pre>\n<p>In addition, you can use JavaScript's native default value syntax to declare default values for the props. This is particularly useful when using the type-based props declaration:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const { foo = 'hello' } = defineProps&lt;{ foo?: string }&gt;()</pre>\n<p>If you prefer to have more visual distinction between destructured props and normal variables in your IDE, Vue's VSCode extension provides a setting to enable inlay-hints for destructured props.</p>\n<h3 id=\"passing-destructured-props-into-functions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Passing Destructured Props into Functions </h3>\n<p>When we pass a destructured prop into a function, e.g.:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const { foo } = defineProps(['foo'])\n\nwatch(foo, /* ... */)</pre>\n<p>This will not work as expected because it is equivalent to <code>watch(props.foo, ...)</code> - we are passing a value instead of a reactive data source to <code>watch</code>. In fact, Vue's compiler will catch such cases and throw a warning.</p>\n<p>Similar to how we can watch a normal prop with <code>watch(() =&gt; props.foo, ...)</code>, we can watch a destructured prop also by wrapping it in a getter:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">watch(() =&gt; foo, /* ... */)</pre>\n<p>In addition, this is the recommended approach when we need to pass a destructured prop into an external function while retaining reactivity:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">useComposable(() =&gt; foo)</pre>\n<p>The external function can call the getter (or normalize it with <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-utilities#tovalue\">toValue</a>) when it needs to track changes of the provided prop, e.g. in a computed or watcher getter.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"prop-passing-details\" tabindex=\"-1\">Prop Passing Details </h2>\n<h3 id=\"prop-name-casing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Prop Name Casing </h3>\n<p>We declare long prop names using camelCase because this avoids having to use quotes when using them as property keys, and allows us to reference them directly in template expressions because they are valid JavaScript identifiers:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">defineProps({\n  greetingMessage: String\n})</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  props: {\n    greetingMessage: String\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;span&gt;{{ greetingMessage }}&lt;/span&gt;</pre>\n<p>Technically, you can also use camelCase when passing props to a child component (except in <a href=\"../essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats\">in-DOM templates</a>). However, the convention is using kebab-case in all cases to align with HTML attributes:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;MyComponent greeting-message=\"hello\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>We use <a href=\"registration#component-name-casing\">PascalCase for component tags</a> when possible because it improves template readability by differentiating Vue components from native elements. However, there isn't as much practical benefit in using camelCase when passing props, so we choose to follow each language's conventions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"static-vs-dynamic-props\" tabindex=\"-1\">Static vs. Dynamic Props </h3>\n<p>So far, you've seen props passed as static values, like in:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;BlogPost title=\"My journey with Vue\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>You've also seen props assigned dynamically with <code>v-bind</code> or its <code>:</code> shortcut, such as in:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- Dynamically assign the value of a variable --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :title=\"post.title\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Dynamically assign the value of a complex expression --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :title=\"post.title + ' by ' + post.author.name\" /&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"passing-different-value-types\" tabindex=\"-1\">Passing Different Value Types </h3>\n<p>In the two examples above, we happen to pass string values, but <em>any</em> type of value can be passed to a prop.</p>\n<h4 id=\"number\" tabindex=\"-1\">Number </h4>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- Even though `42` is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that --&gt;\n&lt;!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.       --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :likes=\"42\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :likes=\"post.likes\" /&gt;</pre>\n<h4 id=\"boolean\" tabindex=\"-1\">Boolean </h4>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- Including the prop with no value will imply `true`. --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost is-published /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Even though `false` is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that --&gt;\n&lt;!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.          --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :is-published=\"false\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :is-published=\"post.isPublished\" /&gt;</pre>\n<h4 id=\"array\" tabindex=\"-1\">Array </h4>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- Even though the array is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that --&gt;\n&lt;!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.            --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :comment-ids=\"[234, 266, 273]\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :comment-ids=\"post.commentIds\" /&gt;</pre>\n<h4 id=\"object\" tabindex=\"-1\">Object </h4>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- Even though the object is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that --&gt;\n&lt;!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.             --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost\n  :author=\"{\n    name: 'Veronica',\n    company: 'Veridian Dynamics'\n  }\"\n /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. --&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost :author=\"post.author\" /&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"binding-multiple-properties-using-an-object\" tabindex=\"-1\">Binding Multiple Properties Using an Object </h3>\n<p>If you want to pass all the properties of an object as props, you can use <a href=\"../essentials/template-syntax#dynamically-binding-multiple-attributes\"><code>v-bind</code> without an argument</a> (<code>v-bind</code> instead of <code>:prop-name</code>). For example, given a <code>post</code> object:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      post: {\n        id: 1,\n        title: 'My Journey with Vue'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const post = {\n  id: 1,\n  title: 'My Journey with Vue'\n}</pre></div>\n<p>The following template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;BlogPost v-bind=\"post\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>Will be equivalent to:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;BlogPost :id=\"post.id\" :title=\"post.title\" /&gt;</pre>\n<h2 id=\"one-way-data-flow\" tabindex=\"-1\">One-Way Data Flow </h2>\n<p>All props form a <strong>one-way-down binding</strong> between the child property and the parent one: when the parent property updates, it will flow down to the child, but not the other way around. This prevents child components from accidentally mutating the parent's state, which can make your app's data flow harder to understand.</p>\n<p>In addition, every time the parent component is updated, all props in the child component will be refreshed with the latest value. This means you should <strong>not</strong> attempt to mutate a prop inside a child component. If you do, Vue will warn you in the console:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const props = defineProps(['foo'])\n\n// ❌ warning, props are readonly!\nprops.foo = 'bar'</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  props: ['foo'],\n  created() {\n    // ❌ warning, props are readonly!\n    this.foo = 'bar'\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<p>There are usually two cases where it's tempting to mutate a prop:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The prop is used to pass in an initial value; the child component wants to use it as a local data property afterwards.</strong> In this case, it's best to define a local data property that uses the prop as its initial value:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const props = defineProps(['initialCounter'])\n\n// counter only uses props.initialCounter as the initial value;\n// it is disconnected from future prop updates.\nconst counter = ref(props.initialCounter)</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  props: ['initialCounter'],\n  data() {\n    return {\n      // counter only uses this.initialCounter as the initial value;\n      // it is disconnected from future prop updates.\n      counter: this.initialCounter\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The prop is passed in as a raw value that needs to be transformed.</strong> In this case, it's best to define a computed property using the prop's value:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const props = defineProps(['size'])\n\n// computed property that auto-updates when the prop changes\nconst normalizedSize = computed(() =&gt; props.size.trim().toLowerCase())</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  props: ['size'],\n  computed: {\n    // computed property that auto-updates when the prop changes\n    normalizedSize() {\n      return this.size.trim().toLowerCase()\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"mutating-object-array-props\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mutating Object / Array Props </h3>\n<p>When objects and arrays are passed as props, while the child component cannot mutate the prop binding, it <strong>will</strong> be able to mutate the object or array's nested properties. This is because in JavaScript objects and arrays are passed by reference, and it is unreasonably expensive for Vue to prevent such mutations.</p>\n<p>The main drawback of such mutations is that it allows the child component to affect parent state in a way that isn't obvious to the parent component, potentially making it more difficult to reason about the data flow in the future. As a best practice, you should avoid such mutations unless the parent and child are tightly coupled by design. In most cases, the child should <a href=\"events\">emit an event</a> to let the parent perform the mutation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prop-validation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Prop Validation </h2>\n<p>Components can specify requirements for their props, such as the types you've already seen. If a requirement is not met, Vue will warn you in the browser's JavaScript console. This is especially useful when developing a component that is intended to be used by others.</p>\n<p>To specify prop validations, you can provide an object with validation requirements to the <span class=\"composition-api\"><code>defineProps()</code> macro</span><span class=\"options-api\"><code>props</code> option</span>, instead of an array of strings. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"js\">defineProps({\n  // Basic type check\n  //  (`null` and `undefined` values will allow any type)\n  propA: Number,\n  // Multiple possible types\n  propB: [String, Number],\n  // Required string\n  propC: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  },\n  // Required but nullable string\n  propD: {\n    type: [String, null],\n    required: true\n  },\n  // Number with a default value\n  propE: {\n    type: Number,\n    default: 100\n  },\n  // Object with a default value\n  propF: {\n    type: Object,\n    // Object or array defaults must be returned from\n    // a factory function.

But in some cases we may want the same callback logic to be run eagerly - for example, we may want to fetch some initial data, and then re-fetch the data whenever relevant state changes.</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<p>We can force a watcher's callback to be executed immediately by declaring it using an object with a <code>handler</code> function and the <code>immediate: true</code> option:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  // ...\n  watch: {\n    question: {\n      handler(newQuestion) {\n        // this will be run immediately on component creation.\n      },\n      // force eager callback execution\n      immediate: true\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}</pre>\n<p>The initial execution of the handler function will happen just before the <code>created</code> hook. Vue will have already processed the <code>data</code>, <code>computed</code>, and <code>methods</code> options, so those properties will be available on the first invocation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>We can force a watcher's callback to be executed immediately by passing the <code>immediate: true</code> option:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">watch(\n  source,\n  (newValue, oldValue) =&gt; {\n    // executed immediately, then again when `source` changes\n  },\n  { immediate: true }\n)</pre>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"once-watchers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Once Watchers </h2>\n<ul><li>Only supported in 3.4+</li></ul>\n<p>Watcher's callback will execute whenever the watched source changes.

For example, consider the following code, which uses a watcher to load a remote resource whenever the <code>todoId</code> ref changes:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const todoId = ref(1)\nconst data = ref(null)\n\nwatch(\n  todoId,\n  async () =&gt; {\n    const response = await fetch(\n      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${todoId.value}`\n    )\n    data.value = await response.json()\n  },\n  { immediate: true }\n)</pre>\n<p>In particular, notice how the watcher uses <code>todoId</code> twice, once as the source and then again inside the callback.</p>\n<p>This can be simplified with <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-core#watcheffect\"><code>watchEffect()</code></a>. <code>watchEffect()</code> allows us to track the callback's reactive dependencies automatically. The watcher above can be rewritten as:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">watchEffect(async () =&gt; {\n  const response = await fetch(\n    `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${todoId.value}`\n  )\n  data.value = await response.json()\n})</pre>\n<p>Here, the callback will run immediately, there's no need to specify <code>immediate: true</code>. During its execution, it will automatically track <code>todoId.value</code> as a dependency (similar to computed properties). Whenever <code>todoId.value</code> changes, the callback will be run again. With <code>watchEffect()</code>, we no longer need to pass <code>todoId</code> explicitly as the source value.</p>\n<p>You can check out <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/examples/#fetching-data\">this example</a> of <code>watchEffect()</code> and reactive data-fetching in action.</p>\n<p>For examples like these, with only one dependency, the benefit of <code>watchEffect()</code> is relatively small. But for watchers that have multiple dependencies, using <code>watchEffect()</code> removes the burden of having to maintain the list of dependencies manually. In addition, if you need to watch several properties in a nested data structure, <code>watchEffect()</code> may prove more efficient than a deep watcher, as it will only track the properties that are used in the callback, rather than recursively tracking all of them.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p><code>watchEffect</code> only tracks dependencies during its <strong>synchronous</strong> execution. When using it with an async callback, only properties accessed before the first <code>await</code> tick will be tracked.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"watch-vs-watcheffect\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<code>watch</code> vs. <code>watchEffect</code> </h3>\n<p><code>watch</code> and <code>watchEffect</code> both allow us to reactively perform side effects. Their main difference is the way they track their reactive dependencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>watch</code> only tracks the explicitly watched source. It won't track anything accessed inside the callback. In addition, the callback only triggers when the source has actually changed. <code>watch</code> separates dependency tracking from the side effect, giving us more precise control over when the callback should fire.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>watchEffect</code>, on the other hand, combines dependency tracking and side effect into one phase. It automatically tracks every reactive property accessed during its synchronous execution. This is more convenient and typically results in terser code, but makes its reactive dependencies less explicit.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"side-effect-cleanup\" tabindex=\"-1\">Side Effect Cleanup </h2>\n<p>Sometimes we may perform side effects, e.g. asynchronous requests, in a watcher:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">watch(id, (newId) =&gt; {\n  fetch(`/api/${newId}`).then(() =&gt; {\n    // callback logic\n  })\n})</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  watch: {\n    id(newId) {\n      fetch(`/api/${newId}`).then(() =&gt; {\n        // callback logic\n      })\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<p>But what if <code>id</code> changes before the request completes? When the previous request completes, it will still fire the callback with an ID value that is already stale. Ideally, we want to be able to cancel the stale request when <code>id</code> changes to a new value.</p>\n<p>We can use the <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-core#onwatchercleanup\"><code>onWatcherCleanup()</code></a>  API to register a cleanup function that will be called when the watcher is invalidated and is about to re-run:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">import { watch, onWatcherCleanup } from 'vue'\n\nwatch(id, (newId) =&gt; {\n  const controller = new AbortController()\n\n  fetch(`/api/${newId}`, { signal: controller.signal }).then(() =&gt; {\n    // callback logic\n  })\n\n  onWatcherCleanup(() =&gt; {\n    // abort stale request\n    controller.abort()\n  })\n})</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">import { onWatcherCleanup } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  watch: {\n    id(newId) {\n      const controller = new AbortController()\n\n      fetch(`/api/${newId}`, { signal: controller.signal }).then(() =&gt; {\n        // callback logic\n      })\n\n      onWatcherCleanup(() =&gt; {\n        // abort stale request\n        controller.abort()\n      })\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<p>Note that <code>onWatcherCleanup</code> is only supported in Vue 3.5+ and must be called during the synchronous execution of a <code>watchEffect</code> effect function or <code>watch</code> callback function: you cannot call it after an <code>await</code> statement in an async function.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, an <code>onCleanup</code> function is also passed to watcher callbacks as the 3rd argument<span class=\"composition-api\">, and to the <code>watchEffect</code> effect function as the first argument</span>:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">watch(id, (newId, oldId, onCleanup) =&gt; {\n  // ...\n  onCleanup(() =&gt; {\n    // cleanup logic\n  })\n})\n\nwatchEffect((onCleanup) =&gt; {\n  // ...\n  onCleanup(() =&gt; {\n    // cleanup logic\n  })\n})</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  watch: {\n    id(newId, oldId, onCleanup) {\n      // ...\n      onCleanup(() =&gt; {\n        // cleanup logic\n      })\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<p>This works in versions before 3.5. In addition, <code>onCleanup</code> passed via function argument is bound to the watcher instance so it is not subject to the synchronously constraint of <code>onWatcherCleanup</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"callback-flush-timing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Callback Flush Timing </h2>\n<p>When you mutate reactive state, it may trigger both Vue component updates and watcher callbacks created by you.</p>\n<p>Similar to component updates, user-created watcher callbacks are batched to avoid duplicate invocations. For example, we probably don't want a watcher to fire a thousand times if we synchronously push a thousand items into an array being watched.</p>\n<p>By default, a watcher's callback is called <strong>after</strong> parent component updates (if any), and <strong>before</strong> the owner component's DOM updates. This means if you attempt to access the owner component's own DOM inside a watcher callback, the DOM will be in a pre-update state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"post-watchers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Post Watchers </h3>\n<p>If you want to access the owner component's DOM in a watcher callback <strong>after</strong> Vue has updated it, you need to specify the <code>flush: 'post'</code> option:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  // ...\n  watch: {\n    key: {\n      handler() {},\n      flush: 'post'\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"js\">watch(source, callback, {\n  flush: 'post'\n})\n\nwatchEffect(callback, {\n  flush: 'post'\n})</pre>\n<p>Post-flush <code>watchEffect()</code> also has a convenience alias, <code>watchPostEffect()</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { watchPostEffect } from 'vue'\n\nwatchPostEffect(() =&gt; {\n  /* executed after Vue updates */\n})</pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"sync-watchers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sync Watchers </h3>\n<p>It's also possible to create a watcher that fires synchronously, before any Vue-managed updates:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  // ...\n  watch: {\n    key: {\n      handler() {},\n      flush: 'sync'\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"js\">watch(source, callback, {\n  flush: 'sync'\n})\n\nwatchEffect(callback, {\n  flush: 'sync'\n})</pre>\n<p>Sync <code>watchEffect()</code> also has a convenience alias, <code>watchSyncEffect()</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { watchSyncEffect } from 'vue'\n\nwatchSyncEffect(() =&gt; {\n  /* executed synchronously upon reactive data change */\n})</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Use with Caution</strong><p>Sync watchers do not have batching and triggers every time a reactive mutation is detected. It's ok to use them to watch simple boolean values, but avoid using them on data sources that might be synchronously mutated many times, e.g. arrays.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<h2 id=\"this-watch\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<code>this.$watch()</code> </h2>\n<p>It's also possible to imperatively create watchers using the <a href=\"../../api/component-instance#watch\"><code>$watch()</code> instance method</a>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  created() {\n    this.$watch('question', (newQuestion) =&gt; {\n      // ...\n    })\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>This is useful when you need to conditionally set up a watcher, or only watch something in response to user interaction. It also allows you to stop the watcher early.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"stopping-a-watcher\" tabindex=\"-1\">Stopping a Watcher </h2>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<p>Watchers declared using the <code>watch</code> option or the <code>$watch()</code> instance method are automatically stopped when the owner component is unmounted, so in most cases you don't need to worry about stopping the watcher yourself.</p>\n<p>In the rare case where you need to stop a watcher before the owner component unmounts, the <code>$watch()</code> API returns a function for that:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const unwatch = this.$watch('foo', callback)\n\n// ...when the watcher is no longer needed:\nunwatch()</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>Watchers declared synchronously inside <code>setup()</code> or <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> are bound to the owner component instance, and will be automatically stopped when the owner component is unmounted. In most cases, you don't need to worry about stopping the watcher yourself.</p>\n<p>The key here is that the watcher must be created <strong>synchronously</strong>: if the watcher is created in an async callback, it won't be bound to the owner component and must be stopped manually to avoid memory leaks. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { watchEffect } from 'vue'\n\n// this one will be automatically stopped\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; {})\n\n// ...this one will not!\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\n  watchEffect(() =&gt; {})\n}, 100)\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>To manually stop a watcher, use the returned handle function. This works for both <code>watch</code> and <code>watchEffect</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const unwatch = watchEffect(() =&gt; {})\n\n// ...later, when no longer needed\nunwatch()</pre>\n<p>Note that there should be very few cases where you need to create watchers asynchronously, and synchronous creation should be preferred whenever possible. If you need to wait for some async data, you can make your watch logic conditional instead:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// data to be loaded asynchronously\nconst data = ref(null)\n\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; {\n  if (data.value) {\n    // do something when data is loaded\n  }\n})</pre>\n</div><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/essentials/component-basics":"<h1 id=\"components-basics\" tabindex=\"-1\">Components Basics </h1>\n<div class=\"scrimba\" type=\"scrimba\" data-v-7a8c3350><a href=\"https://scrimba.com/links/vue-component-basics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" title=\"Free Vue.js Components Basics Lesson\" data-v-7a8c3350> Watch an interactive video lesson on Scrimba </a></div>\n<p>Components allow us to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

alt=\"Component Tree\"></p>\n<p>This is very similar to how we nest native HTML elements, but Vue implements its own component model that allows us to encapsulate custom content and logic in each component. Vue also plays nicely with native Web Components. If you are curious about the relationship between Vue Components and native Web Components, <a href=\"../extras/web-components\">read more here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-a-component\" tabindex=\"-1\">Defining a Component </h2>\n<p>When using a build step, we typically define each Vue component in a dedicated file using the <code>.vue</code> extension - known as a <a href=\"../scaling-up/sfc\">Single-File Component</a> (SFC for short):</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;You clicked me {{ count }} times.&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;You clicked me {{ count }} times.&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre></div>\n<p>When not using a build step, a Vue component can be defined as a plain JavaScript object containing Vue-specific options:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n    &lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;\n      You clicked me {{ count }} times.\n    &lt;/button&gt;`\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n    return { count }\n  },\n  template: `\n    &lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;\n      You clicked me {{ count }} times.\n    &lt;/button&gt;`\n  // Can also target an in-DOM template:\n  // template: '#my-template-element'\n}</pre></div>\n<p>The template is inlined as a JavaScript string here, which Vue will compile on the fly. You can also use an ID selector pointing to an element (usually native <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> elements) - Vue will use its content as the template source.</p>\n<p>The example above defines a single component and exports it as the default export of a <code>.js</code> file, but you can use named exports to export multiple components from the same file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-a-component\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using a Component </h2>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>We will be using SFC syntax for the rest of this guide - the concepts around components are the same regardless of whether you are using a build step or not. The <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/examples/\">Examples</a> section shows component usage in both scenarios.</p>\n</div>\n<p>To use a child component, we need to import it in the parent component. Assuming we placed our counter component inside a file called <code>ButtonCounter.vue</code>, the component will be exposed as the file's default export:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nimport ButtonCounter from './ButtonCounter.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    ButtonCounter\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Here is a child component!&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;ButtonCounter /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>To expose the imported component to our template, we need to <a href=\"../components/registration\">register</a> it with the <code>components</code> option. The component will then be available as a tag using the key it is registered under.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport ButtonCounter from './ButtonCounter.vue'\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Here is a child component!&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;ButtonCounter /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>With <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, imported components are automatically made available to the template.</p>\n</div>\n<p>It's also possible to globally register a component, making it available to all components in a given app without having to import it. The pros and cons of global vs. local registration is discussed in the dedicated <a href=\"../components/registration\">Component Registration</a> section.</p>\n<p>Components can be reused as many times as you want:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;h1&gt;Here are many child components!&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ButtonCounter /&gt;\n&lt;ButtonCounter /&gt;\n&lt;ButtonCounter /&gt;</pre>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqVUE1LxDAQ/StjLqusNHotcfHj4l8QcontLBtsJiGdiFL6301SdrEqyEJyeG9m3ps3k3gIoXlPKFqhxi7awDtN1gUfGR4Ts6cnn4gxwj56B5tGrtgyutEEoAk/6lCPe5MGhqmwnc9KhMRjuxCwFi3UrCk/JU/uGTC6MBjGglgdbnfPGBFM/s7QJ3QHO/TfxC+UzD21d72zPItU8uQrrsWvnKsT/ZW2N2wur45BI3KKdETlFlmphZsF58j/RgdQr3UJuO8G273daVFFtlstahngxSeoNezBIUzTYgPzDGwdjk1VkYvMj4jzF0nwsyQ=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqVj91KAzEQhV/lmJsqlY3eSlr8ufEVhNys6ZQGNz8kE0GWfXez2SJUsdCLuZiZM9+ZM4qnGLvPQuJBqGySjYxMXOJWe+tiSIznwhz8SyieKWGfgsOqkyfTGbDSXsmFUG9rw+Ti0DPNHavD/faVEqGv5Xr/BXOwww4mVBNPnvOVklXTtKeO8qKhkj++4lb8+fL/mCMS7TEdAy6BtDfBZ65fVgA2s+L67uZMUEC9N0s8msGaj40W7Xa91qKtgbdQ0Ha0gyOM45E+TWDrKHeNIhfMr0DTN4U0me8=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<p>Notice that when clicking on the buttons, each one maintains its own, separate <code>count</code>. That's because each time you use a component, a new <strong>instance</strong> of it is created.</p>\n<p>In SFCs, it's recommended to use <code>PascalCase</code> tag names for child components to differentiate from native HTML elements. Although native HTML tag names are case-insensitive, Vue SFC is a compiled format so we are able to use case-sensitive tag names in it. We are also able to use <code>/&gt;</code> to close a tag.</p>\n<p>If you are authoring your templates directly in a DOM (e.g. as the content of a native <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element), the template will be subject to the browser's native HTML parsing behavior. In such cases, you will need to use <code>kebab-case</code> and explicit closing tags for components:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- if this template is written in the DOM --&gt;\n&lt;button-counter&gt;&lt;/button-counter&gt;\n&lt;button-counter&gt;&lt;/button-counter&gt;\n&lt;button-counter&gt;&lt;/button-counter&gt;</pre>\n<p>See <a href=\"#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats\">in-DOM template parsing caveats</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"passing-props\" tabindex=\"-1\">Passing Props </h2>\n<p>If we are building a blog, we will likely need a component representing a blog post. We want all the blog posts to share the same visual layout, but with different content. Such a component won't be useful unless you can pass data to it, such as the title and content of the specific post we want to display. That's where props come in.</p>\n<p>Props are custom attributes you can register on a component. To pass a title to our blog post component, we must declare it in the list of props this component accepts, using the <span class=\"options-api\"><a href=\"../../api/options-state#props\"><code>props</code></a> option</span><span class=\"composition-api\"><a href=\"../../api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits\"><code>defineProps</code></a> macro</span>:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"BlogPost.vue\">BlogPost.vue</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n  props: ['title']\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;h4&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p>When a value is passed to a prop attribute, it becomes a property on that component instance. The value of that property is accessible within the template and on the component's <code>this</code> context, just like any other component property.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"BlogPost.vue\">BlogPost.vue</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\ndefineProps(['title'])\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;h4&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p><code>defineProps</code> is a compile-time macro that is only available inside <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> and does not need to be explicitly imported. Declared props are automatically exposed to the template. <code>defineProps</code> also returns an object that contains all the props passed to the component, so that we can access them in JavaScript if needed:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const props = defineProps(['title'])\nconsole.log(props.title)</pre>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"../typescript/composition-api#typing-component-props\">Typing Component Props</a> </p>\n<p>If you are not using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, props should be declared using the <code>props</code> option, and the props object will be passed to <code>setup()</code> as the first argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  props: ['title'],\n  setup(props) {\n    console.log(props.title)\n  }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>A component can have as many props as you like and, by default, any value can be passed to any prop.</p>\n<p>Once a prop is registered, you can pass data to it as a custom attribute, like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;BlogPost title=\"My journey with Vue\" /&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost title=\"Blogging with Vue\" /&gt;\n&lt;BlogPost title=\"Why Vue is so fun\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>In a typical app, however, you'll likely have an array of posts in your parent component:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  // ...\n  data() {\n    return {\n      posts: [\n        { id: 1, title: 'My journey with Vue' },\n        { id: 2, title: 'Blogging with Vue' },\n        { id: 3, title: 'Why Vue is so fun' }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const posts = ref([\n  { id: 1, title: 'My journey with Vue' },\n  { id: 2, title: 'Blogging with Vue' },\n  { id: 3, title: 'Why Vue is so fun' }\n])</pre></div>\n<p>Then want to render a component for each one, using <code>v-for</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;BlogPost\n  v-for=\"post in posts\"\n  :key=\"post.id\"\n  :title=\"post.title\"\n /&gt;</pre>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9UU1rhDAU/CtDLrawVfpxklRo74We2kPtQdaoaTUJ8bmtiP+9ia6uC2VBgjOZeXnz3sCejAkPnWAx4+3eSkNJqmRjtCU817p81S2hsLpBEEYL4Q1BqoBUid9Jmosi62rC4Nm9dn4lFLXxTGAt5dG482eeUXZ1vdxbQZ1VCwKM0zr3x4KBATKPcbsDSapFjOClx5d2JtHjR1KFN9fTsfbWcXdy+CZKqcqL+vuT/r3qvQqyRatRdMrpF/nn/DNhd7iPR+v8HCDRmDoj4RHxbfyUDjeFto8p8yEh1Rw2ZV4JxN+iP96FMvest8RTTws/gdmQ8HUr7ikere+yHduu62y//y3NWG38xIOpeODyXcoE8OohGYZ5VhhHHjl83sD4B3XgyGI=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp9kU9PhDAUxL/KpBfWBCH+OZEuid5N9qSHrQezFKhC27RlDSF8d1tYQBP1+N78OpN5HciD1sm54yQj1J6M0A6Wu07nTIpWK+MwwPASI0qjWkQejVbpsVHVQVl30ZJ0WQRHjwFMnpT0gPZLi32w2h2DMEAUGW5iOOEaniF66vGuOiN5j0/hajx7B4zxxt5ubIiphKz+IO828qXugw5hYRXKTnqSydcrJmk61/VF/eB4q5s3x8Pk6FJjauDO16Uye0ZCBwg5d2EkkED2wfuLlogibMOTbMpf9tMwP8jpeiMfRdM1l8Tk+/F++Y6Cl0Lyg1Ha7o7R5Bn9WwSg9X0+DPMxMI409fPP1PELlVmwdQ==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<p>Notice how <a href=\"../../api/built-in-directives#v-bind\"><code>v-bind</code> syntax</a> (<code>:title=\"post.title\"</code>) is used to pass dynamic prop values.

For example, we may decide to include an accessibility feature to enlarge the text of blog posts, while leaving the rest of the page at its default size.</p>\n<p>In the parent, we can support this feature by adding a <code>postFontSize</code> <span class=\"options-api\">data property</span><span class=\"composition-api\">ref</span>:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">data() {\n  return {\n    posts: [\n      /* ... */\n    ],\n    postFontSize: 1\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const posts = ref([\n  /* ... */\n])\n\nconst postFontSize = ref(1)</pre></div>\n<p>Which can be used in the template to control the font size of all blog posts:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div :style=\"{ fontSize: postFontSize + 'em' }\"&gt;\n  &lt;BlogPost\n    v-for=\"post in posts\"\n    :key=\"post.id\"\n    :title=\"post.title\"\n   /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>Now let's add a button to the <code>&lt;BlogPost&gt;</code> component's template:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"BlogPost.vue\">BlogPost.vue</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;!-- omitting &lt;script&gt; --&gt;\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"blog-post\"&gt;\n    &lt;h4&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h4&gt;\n    &lt;button&gt;Enlarge text&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The button doesn't do anything yet - we want clicking the button to communicate to the parent that it should enlarge the text of all posts. To solve this problem, components provide a custom events system. The parent can choose to listen to any event on the child component instance with <code>v-on</code> or <code>@</code>, just as we would with a native DOM event:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;BlogPost\n  ...\n  @enlarge-text=\"postFontSize += 0.1\"\n /&gt;</pre>\n<p>Then the child component can emit an event on itself by calling the built-in <a href=\"../../api/component-instance#emit\"><strong><code>$emit</code></strong> method</a>, passing the name of the event:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"BlogPost.vue\">BlogPost.vue</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;!-- omitting &lt;script&gt; --&gt;\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"blog-post\"&gt;\n    &lt;h4&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h4&gt;\n    &lt;button @click=\"$emit('enlarge-text')\"&gt;Enlarge text&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p>Thanks to the <code>@enlarge-text=\"postFontSize += 0.1\"</code> listener, the parent will receive the event and update the value of <code>postFontSize</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<p>We can optionally declare emitted events using the <span class=\"options-api\"><a href=\"../../api/options-state#emits\"><code>emits</code></a> option</span><span class=\"composition-api\"><a href=\"../../api/sfc-script-setup#defineprops-defineemits\"><code>defineEmits</code></a> macro</span>:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"BlogPost.vue\">BlogPost.vue</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n  props: ['title'],\n  emits: ['enlarge-text']\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"BlogPost.vue\">BlogPost.vue</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\ndefineProps(['title'])\ndefineEmits(['enlarge-text'])\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>This documents all the events that a component emits and optionally <a href=\"../components/events#events-validation\">validates them</a>.

This leads to some caveats due to browsers' native HTML parsing behavior.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>It should be noted that the limitations discussed below only apply if you are writing your templates directly in the DOM. They do NOT apply if you are using string templates from the following sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single-File Components</li>\n<li>Inlined template strings (e.g. <code>template: '...'</code>)</li>\n<li><code>&lt;script type=\"text/x-template\"&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"case-insensitivity\" tabindex=\"-1\">Case Insensitivity </h3>\n<p>HTML tags and attribute names are case-insensitive, so browsers will interpret any uppercase characters as lowercase. That means when you’re using in-DOM templates, PascalCase component names and camelCased prop names or <code>v-on</code> event names all need to use their kebab-cased (hyphen-delimited) equivalents:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// camelCase in JavaScript\nconst BlogPost = {\n  props: ['postTitle'],\n  emits: ['updatePost'],\n  template: `\n    &lt;h3&gt;{{ postTitle }}&lt;/h3&gt;\n  `\n}</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- kebab-case in HTML --&gt;\n&lt;blog-post post-title=\"hello!\" @update-post=\"onUpdatePost\"&gt;&lt;/blog-post&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"self-closing-tags\" tabindex=\"-1\">Self Closing Tags </h3>\n<p>We have been using self-closing tags for components in previous code samples:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;MyComponent /&gt;</pre>\n<p>This is because Vue's template parser respects <code>/&gt;</code> as an indication to end any tag, regardless of its type.</p>\n<p>In in-DOM templates, however, we must always include explicit closing tags:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;my-component&gt;&lt;/my-component&gt;</pre>\n<p>This is because the HTML spec only allows <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a few specific elements</a> to omit closing tags, the most common being <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. For all other elements, if you omit the closing tag, the native HTML parser will think you never terminated the opening tag. For example, the following snippet:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;my-component /&gt; &lt;!-- we intend to close the tag here... --&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;</pre>\n<p>will be parsed as:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;my-component&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/my-component&gt; &lt;!-- but the browser will close it here. --&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"element-placement-restrictions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Element Placement Restrictions </h3>\n<p>Some HTML elements, such as <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> have restrictions on what elements can appear inside them, and some elements such as <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> can only appear inside certain other elements.</p>\n<p>This will lead to issues when using components with elements that have such restrictions. For example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;blog-post-row&gt;&lt;/blog-post-row&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;</pre>\n<p>The custom component <code>&lt;blog-post-row&gt;</code> will be hoisted out as invalid content, causing errors in the eventual rendered output. We can use the special <a href=\"../../api/built-in-special-attributes#is\"><code>is</code> attribute</a> as a workaround:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;tr is=\"vue:blog-post-row\"&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;</pre>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>When used on native HTML elements, the value of <code>is</code> must be prefixed with <code>vue:</code> in order to be interpreted as a Vue component. This is required to avoid confusion with native <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">customized built-in elements</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>That's all you need to know about in-DOM template parsing caveats for now - and actually, the end of Vue's <em>Essentials</em>.

The injection key is used by descendant components to lookup the desired value to inject. A single component can call <code>provide()</code> multiple times with different injection keys to provide different values.</p>\n<p>The second argument is the provided value.

Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.</p>\n<p>A custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component. The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to. Here is an example of a directive that adds a class to an element when it is inserted into the DOM by Vue:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\n// enables v-highlight in templates\nconst vHighlight = {\n  mounted: (el) =&gt; {\n    el.classList.add('is-highlight')\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;p v-highlight&gt;This sentence is important!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const highlight = {\n  mounted: (el) =&gt; el.classList.add('is-highlight')\n}\n\nexport default {\n  directives: {\n    // enables v-highlight in template\n    highlight\n  }\n}</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;p v-highlight&gt;This sentence is important!&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>In <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, any camelCase variable that starts with the <code>v</code> prefix can be used as a custom directive. In the example above, <code>vHighlight</code> can be used in the template as <code>v-highlight</code>.</p>\n<p>If you are not using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, custom directives can be registered using the <code>directives</code> option:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  setup() {\n    /*...*/\n  },\n  directives: {\n    // enables v-highlight in template\n    highlight: {\n      /* ... */\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p>Similar to components, custom directives must be registered so that they can be used in templates. In the example above, we are using local registration via the <code>directives</code> option.</p></div>\n<p>It is also common to globally register custom directives at the app level:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const app = createApp({})\n\n// make v-highlight usable in all components\napp.directive('highlight', {\n  /* ... */\n})</pre>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use\" tabindex=\"-1\">When to use custom directives </h2>\n<p>Custom directives should only be used when the desired functionality can only be achieved via direct DOM manipulation.</p>\n<p>A common example of this is a <code>v-focus</code> custom directive that brings an element into focus.</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\n// enables v-focus in templates\nconst vFocus = {\n  mounted: (el) =&gt; el.focus()\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;input v-focus /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const focus = {\n  mounted: (el) =&gt; el.focus()\n}\n\nexport default {\n  directives: {\n    // enables v-focus in template\n    focus\n  }\n}</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;input v-focus /&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p>This directive is more useful than the <code>autofocus</code> attribute because it works not just on page load - it also works when the element is dynamically inserted by Vue!</p>\n<p>Declarative templating with built-in directives such as <code>v-bind</code> is recommended when possible because they are more efficient and server-rendering friendly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directive-hooks\" tabindex=\"-1\">Directive Hooks </h2>\n<p>A directive definition object can provide several hook functions (all optional):</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const myDirective = {\n  // called before bound element's attributes\n  // or event listeners are applied\n  created(el, binding, vnode) {\n    // see below for details on arguments\n  },\n  // called right before the element is inserted into the DOM.\n  beforeMount(el, binding, vnode) {},\n  // called when the bound element's parent component\n  // and all its children are mounted.\n  mounted(el, binding, vnode) {},\n  // called before the parent component is updated\n  beforeUpdate(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},\n  // called after the parent component and\n  // all of its children have updated\n  updated(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},\n  // called before the parent component is unmounted\n  beforeUnmount(el, binding, vnode) {},\n  // called when the parent component is unmounted\n  unmounted(el, binding, vnode) {}\n}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"hook-arguments\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hook Arguments </h3>\n<p>Directive hooks are passed these arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>el</code>: the element the directive is bound to. This can be used to directly manipulate the DOM.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p><code>binding</code>: an object containing the following properties.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>value</code>: The value passed to the directive. For example in <code>v-my-directive=\"1 + 1\"</code>, the value would be <code>2</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<code>oldValue</code>: The previous value, only available in <code>beforeUpdate</code> and <code>updated</code>. It is available whether or not the value has changed.</li>\n<li>\n<code>arg</code>: The argument passed to the directive, if any. For example in <code>v-my-directive:foo</code>, the arg would be <code>\"foo\"</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<code>modifiers</code>: An object containing modifiers, if any. For example in <code>v-my-directive.foo.bar</code>, the modifiers object would be <code>{ foo: true, bar: true }</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<code>instance</code>: The instance of the component where the directive is used.</li>\n<li>\n<code>dir</code>: the directive definition object.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>vnode</code>: the underlying VNode representing the bound element.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>prevVnode</code>: the VNode representing the bound element from the previous render. Only available in the <code>beforeUpdate</code> and <code>updated</code> hooks.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an example, consider the following directive usage:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div v-example:foo.bar=\"baz\"&gt;</pre>\n<p>The <code>binding</code> argument would be an object in the shape of:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">{\n  arg: 'foo',\n  modifiers: { bar: true },\n  value: /* value of `baz` */,\n  oldValue: /* value of `baz` from previous update */\n}</pre>\n<p>Similar to built-in directives, custom directive arguments can be dynamic. For example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div v-example:[arg]=\"value\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>Here the directive argument will be reactively updated based on <code>arg</code> property in our component state.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Note</strong><p>Apart from <code>el</code>, you should treat these arguments as read-only and never modify them. If you need to share information across hooks, it is recommended to do so through element's <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">dataset</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"function-shorthand\" tabindex=\"-1\">Function Shorthand </h2>\n<p>It's common for a custom directive to have the same behavior for <code>mounted</code> and <code>updated</code>, with no need for the other hooks. In such cases we can define the directive as a function:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div v-color=\"color\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">app.directive('color', (el, binding) =&gt; {\n  // this will be called for both `mounted` and `updated`\n  el.style.color = binding.value\n})</pre>\n<h2 id=\"object-literals\" tabindex=\"-1\">Object Literals </h2>\n<p>If your directive needs multiple values, you can also pass in a JavaScript object literal.

its fancy styling), while the inner content is provided by the parent component.</p>\n<p>Another way to understand slots is by comparing them to JavaScript functions:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">//

We can now use it in different places with different inner content, but all with the same fancy styling.</p>\n<p>Vue components' slot mechanism is inspired by the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">native Web Component <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> element</a>, but with additional capabilities that we will see later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"render-scope\" tabindex=\"-1\">Render Scope </h2>\n<p>Slot content has access to the data scope of the parent component, because it is defined in the parent. For example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;span&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;FancyButton&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/FancyButton&gt;</pre>\n<p>Here both <span><code>{{ message }}</code></span> interpolations will render the same content.</p>\n<p>Slot content does <strong>not</strong> have access to the child component's data. Expressions in Vue templates can only access the scope it is defined in, consistent with JavaScript's lexical scoping. In other words:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Expressions in the parent template only have access to the parent scope; expressions in the child template only have access to the child scope.</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"fallback-content\" tabindex=\"-1\">Fallback Content </h2>\n<p>There are cases when it's useful to specify fallback (i.e. default) content for a slot, to be rendered only when no content is provided. For example, in a <code>&lt;SubmitButton&gt;</code> component:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;\n  &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;</pre>\n<p>We might want the text \"Submit\" to be rendered inside the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> if the parent didn't provide any slot content. To make \"Submit\" the fallback content, we can place it in between the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tags:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;\n  &lt;slot&gt;\n    Submit &lt;!-- fallback content --&gt;\n  &lt;/slot&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;</pre>\n<p>Now when we use <code>&lt;SubmitButton&gt;</code> in a parent component, providing no content for the slot:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;SubmitButton /&gt;</pre>\n<p>This will render the fallback content, \"Submit\":</p>\n<pre data-language=\"html\">&lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;</pre>\n<p>But if we provide content:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;SubmitButton&gt;Save&lt;/SubmitButton&gt;</pre>\n<p>Then the provided content will be rendered instead:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"html\">&lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;</pre>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp1kMsKwjAQRX9lzMaNbfcSC/oL3WbT1ikU8yKZFEX8d5MGgi2YVeZxZ86dN7taWy8B2ZlxP7rZEnikYFuhZ2WNI+jCoGa6BSKjYXJGwbFufpNJfhSaN1kflTEgVFb2hDEC4IeqguARpl7KoR8fQPgkqKpc3Wxo1lxRWWeW+Y4wBk9x9V9d2/UL8g1XbOJN4WAntodOnrecQ2agl8WLYH7tFyw5olj10iR3EJ+gPCxDFluj0YS6EAqKR8mi9M3Td1ifLxWShcU=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNp1UEEOwiAQ/MrKxYu1d4Mm+gWvXChuk0YKpCyNxvh3lxIb28SEA8zuDDPzEucQ9mNCcRAymqELdFKu64MfCK6p6Tu6JCLvoB18D9t9/Qtm4lY5AOXwMVFu2OpkCV4ZNZ51HDqKhwLAQjIjb+X4yHr+mh+EfbCakF8AclNVkCJCq61ttLkD4YOgqsp0YbGesJkVBj92NwSTIrH3v7zTVY8oF8F4SdazD7ET69S5rqXPpnigZ8CjEnHaVyInIp5G63O6XIGiIlZMzrGMd8RVfR0q4lIKKV+L+srW+wNTTZq3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<h2 id=\"named-slots\" tabindex=\"-1\">Named Slots </h2>\n<p>There are times when it's useful to have multiple slot outlets in a single component. For example, in a <code>&lt;BaseLayout&gt;</code> component with the following template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;!-- We want header content here --&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;main&gt;\n    &lt;!-- We want main content here --&gt;\n  &lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;footer&gt;\n    &lt;!-- We want footer content here --&gt;\n  &lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>For these cases, the <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> element has a special attribute, <code>name</code>, which can be used to assign a unique ID to different slots so you can determine where content should be rendered:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;slot name=\"header\"&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;main&gt;\n    &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;\n  &lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;footer&gt;\n    &lt;slot name=\"footer\"&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;\n  &lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>A <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> outlet without <code>name</code> implicitly has the name \"default\".</p>\n<p>In a parent component using <code>&lt;BaseLayout&gt;</code>, we need a way to pass multiple slot content fragments, each targeting a different slot outlet. This is where <strong>named slots</strong> come in.</p>\n<p>To pass a named slot, we need to use a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element with the <code>v-slot</code> directive, and then pass the name of the slot as an argument to <code>v-slot</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;BaseLayout&gt;\n  &lt;template v-slot:header&gt;\n    &lt;!-- content for the header slot --&gt;\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/BaseLayout&gt;</pre>\n<p><code>v-slot</code> has a dedicated shorthand <code>#</code>, so <code>&lt;template v-slot:header&gt;</code> can be shortened to just <code>&lt;template #header&gt;</code>.

&lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/BaseLayout&gt;</pre>\n<p>When a component accepts both a default slot and named slots, all top-level non-<code>&lt;template&gt;</code> nodes are implicitly treated as content for the default slot. So the above can also be written as:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;BaseLayout&gt;\n  &lt;template #header&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Here might be a page title&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- implicit default slot --&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;A paragraph for the main content.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;And another one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;template #footer&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Here's some contact info&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/BaseLayout&gt;</pre>\n<p>Now everything inside the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> elements will be passed to the corresponding slots.

The child component then calls it, passing props as arguments:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">MyComponent({\n  // passing the default slot, but as a function\n  default: (slotProps) =&gt; {\n    return `${slotProps.text} ${slotProps.count}`\n  }\n})\n\nfunction MyComponent(slots) {\n  const greetingMessage = 'hello'\n  return `&lt;div&gt;${\n    // call the slot function with props!\n    slots.default({ text: greetingMessage, count: 1 })\n  }&lt;/div&gt;`\n}</pre>\n<p>In fact, this is very close to how scoped slots are compiled, and how you would use scoped slots in manual <a href=\"../extras/render-function\">render functions</a>.</p>\n<p>Notice how <code>v-slot=\"slotProps\"</code> matches the slot function signature. Just like with function arguments, we can use destructuring in <code>v-slot</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;MyComponent v-slot=\"{ text, count }\"&gt;\n  {{ text }} {{ count }}\n&lt;/MyComponent&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"named-scoped-slots\" tabindex=\"-1\">Named Scoped Slots </h3>\n<p>Named scoped slots work similarly - slot props are accessible as the value of the <code>v-slot</code> directive: <code>v-slot:name=\"slotProps\"</code>. When using the shorthand, it looks like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;MyComponent&gt;\n  &lt;template #header=\"headerProps\"&gt;\n    {{ headerProps }}\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n\n  &lt;template #default=\"defaultProps\"&gt;\n    {{ defaultProps }}\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n\n  &lt;template #footer=\"footerProps\"&gt;\n    {{ footerProps }}\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/MyComponent&gt;</pre>\n<p>Passing props to a named slot:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;slot name=\"header\" message=\"hello\"&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;</pre>\n<p>Note the <code>name</code> of a slot won't be included in the props because it is reserved - so the resulting <code>headerProps</code> would be <code>{ message: 'hello' }</code>.</p>\n<p>If you are mixing named slots with the default scoped slot, you need to use an explicit <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag for the default slot. Attempting to place the <code>v-slot</code> directive directly on the component will result in a compilation error. This is to avoid any ambiguity about the scope of the props of the default slot. For example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- &lt;MyComponent&gt; template --&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;slot :message=\"hello\"&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;\n  &lt;slot name=\"footer\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- This template won't compile --&gt;\n&lt;MyComponent v-slot=\"{ message }\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;template #footer&gt;\n    &lt;!-- message belongs to the default slot, and is not available here --&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/MyComponent&gt;</pre>\n<p>Using an explicit <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag for the default slot helps to make it clear that the <code>message</code> prop is not available inside the other slot:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;MyComponent&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Use explicit default slot --&gt;\n  &lt;template #default=\"{ message }\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n\n  &lt;template #footer&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Here's some contact info&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/MyComponent&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"fancy-list-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Fancy List Example </h3>\n<p>You may be wondering what would be a good use case for scoped slots. Here's an example: imagine a <code>&lt;FancyList&gt;</code> component that renders a list of items - it may encapsulate the logic for loading remote data, using the data to display a list, or even advanced features like pagination or infinite scrolling. However, we want it to be flexible with how each item looks and leave the styling of each item to the parent component consuming it. So the desired usage may look like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;FancyList :api-url=\"url\" :per-page=\"10\"&gt;\n  &lt;template #item=\"{ body, username, likes }\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"item\"&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;{{ body }}&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;by {{ username }} | {{ likes }} likes&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/FancyList&gt;</pre>\n<p>Inside <code>&lt;FancyList&gt;</code>, we can render the same <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> multiple times with different item data (notice we are using <code>v-bind</code> to pass an object as slot props):</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li v-for=\"item in items\"&gt;\n    &lt;slot name=\"item\" v-bind=\"item\"&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<h3 id=\"renderless-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Renderless Components </h3>\n<p>The <code>&lt;FancyList&gt;</code> use case we discussed above encapsulates both reusable logic (data fetching, pagination etc.) and visual output, while delegating part of the visual output to the consumer component via scoped slots.</p>\n<p>If we push this concept a bit further, we can come up with components that only encapsulate logic and do not render anything by themselves - visual output is fully delegated to the consumer component with scoped slots.

To make that possible, Vue has a <a href=\"../../api/general#defineasynccomponent\"><code>defineAsyncComponent</code></a> function:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\nconst AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent(() =&gt; {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    // ...load component from server\n    resolve(/* loaded component */)\n  })\n})\n// ... use `AsyncComp` like a normal component</pre>\n<p>As you can see, <code>defineAsyncComponent</code> accepts a loader function that returns a Promise. The Promise's <code>resolve</code> callback should be called when you have retrieved your component definition from the server. You can also call <code>reject(reason)</code> to indicate the load has failed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ES module dynamic import</a> also returns a Promise, so most of the time we will use it in combination with <code>defineAsyncComponent</code>. Bundlers like Vite and webpack also support the syntax (and will use it as bundle split points), so we can use it to import Vue SFCs:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\nconst AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent(() =&gt;\n  import('./components/MyComponent.vue')\n)</pre>\n<p>The resulting <code>AsyncComp</code> is a wrapper component that only calls the loader function when it is actually rendered on the page. In addition, it will pass along any props and slots to the inner component, so you can use the async wrapper to seamlessly replace the original component while achieving lazy loading.</p>\n<p>As with normal components, async components can be <a href=\"registration#global-registration\">registered globally</a> using <code>app.component()</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">app.component('MyComponent', defineAsyncComponent(() =&gt;\n  import('./components/MyComponent.vue')\n))</pre>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<p>You can also use <code>defineAsyncComponent</code> when <a href=\"registration#local-registration\">registering a component locally</a>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nimport { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    AdminPage: defineAsyncComponent(() =&gt;\n      import('./components/AdminPageComponent.vue')\n    )\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;AdminPage /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>They can also be defined directly inside their parent component:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\nconst AdminPage = defineAsyncComponent(() =&gt;\n  import('./components/AdminPageComponent.vue')\n)\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;AdminPage /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"loading-and-error-states\" tabindex=\"-1\">Loading and Error States </h2>\n<p>Asynchronous operations inevitably involve loading and error states - <code>defineAsyncComponent()</code> supports handling these states via advanced options:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent({\n  // the loader function\n  loader: () =&gt; import('./Foo.vue'),\n\n  // A component to use while the async component is loading\n  loadingComponent: LoadingComponent,\n  // Delay before showing the loading component.

Default: Infinity.\n  timeout: 3000\n})</pre>\n<p>If a loading component is provided, it will be displayed first while the inner component is being loaded. There is a default 200ms delay before the loading component is shown - this is because on fast networks, an instant loading state may get replaced too fast and end up looking like a flicker.</p>\n<p>If an error component is provided, it will be displayed when the Promise returned by the loader function is rejected.

If you have been learning Vue with Options API only, you can set the API Preference to Composition API (using the toggle at the top of the left sidebar) and re-read the <a href=\"../essentials/reactivity-fundamentals\">Reactivity Fundamentals</a> and <a href=\"../essentials/lifecycle\">Lifecycle Hooks</a> chapters.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-composable\" tabindex=\"-1\">What is a \"Composable\"? </h2>\n<p>In the context of Vue applications, a \"composable\" is a function that leverages Vue's Composition API to encapsulate and reuse <strong>stateful logic</strong>.</p>\n<p>When building frontend applications, we often need to reuse logic for common tasks. For example, we may need to format dates in many places, so we extract a reusable function for that. This formatter function encapsulates <strong>stateless logic</strong>: it takes some input and immediately returns expected output. There are many libraries out there for reusing stateless logic - for example <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lodash</a> and <a href=\"https://date-fns.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">date-fns</a>, which you may have heard of.</p>\n<p>By contrast, stateful logic involves managing state that changes over time. A simple example would be tracking the current position of the mouse on a page. In real-world scenarios, it could also be more complex logic such as touch gestures or connection status to a database.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mouse-tracker-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mouse Tracker Example </h2>\n<p>If we were to implement the mouse tracking functionality using the Composition API directly inside a component, it would look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"MouseComponent.vue\">MouseComponent.vue</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'\n\nconst x = ref(0)\nconst y = ref(0)\n\nfunction update(event) {\n  x.value = event.pageX\n  y.value = event.pageY\n}\n\nonMounted(() =&gt; window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))\nonUnmounted(() =&gt; window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p>But what if we want to reuse the same logic in multiple components? We can extract the logic into an external file, as a composable function:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"mouse.js\">mouse.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'\n\n// by convention, composable function names start with \"use\"\nexport function useMouse() {\n  // state encapsulated and managed by the composable\n  const x = ref(0)\n  const y = ref(0)\n\n  // a composable can update its managed state over time.\n  function update(event) {\n    x.value = event.pageX\n    y.value = event.pageY\n  }\n\n  // a composable can also hook into its owner component's\n  // lifecycle to setup and teardown side effects.\n  onMounted(() =&gt; window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))\n  onUnmounted(() =&gt; window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))\n\n  // expose managed state as return value\n  return { x, y }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>And this is how it can be used in components:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"MouseComponent.vue\">MouseComponent.vue</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { useMouse } from './mouse.js'\n\nconst { x, y } = useMouse()\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNkj1rwzAQhv/KocUOGKVzSAIdurVjoQUvJj4XlfgkJNmxMfrvPcmJkkKHLrbu69H7SlrEszFyHFDsxN6drDIeHPrBHGtSvdHWwwKDwzfNHwjQWd1DIbd9jOW3K2qq6aTJxb6pgpl7Dnmg3NS0365YBnLgsTfnxiNHACvUaKe80gTKQeN3sDAIQqjignEhIvKYqMRta1acFVrsKtDEQPLYxuU7cV8Msmg2mdTilIa6gU5p27tYWKKq1c3ENphaPrGFW25+yMXsHWFaFlfiiOSvFIBJjs15QJ5JeWmaL/xYS/Mfpc9YYrPxl52ULOpwhIuiVl9k07Yvsf9VOY+EtizSWfR6xKK6itgkvQ/+fyNs6v4XJXIsPwVL+WprCiL8AEUxw5s=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p>\n<p>As we can see, the core logic remains identical - all we had to do was move it into an external function and return the state that should be exposed. Just like inside a component, you can use the full range of <a href=\"../../api/index#composition-api\">Composition API functions</a> in composables. The same <code>useMouse()</code> functionality can now be used in any component.</p>\n<p>The cooler part about composables though, is that you can also nest them: one composable function can call one or more other composable functions. This enables us to compose complex logic using small, isolated units, similar to how we compose an entire application using components. In fact, this is why we decided to call the collection of APIs that make this pattern possible Composition API.</p>\n<p>For example, we can extract the logic of adding and removing a DOM event listener into its own composable:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"event.js\">event.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useEventListener(target, event, callback) {\n  // if you want, you can also make this\n  // support selector strings as target\n  onMounted(() =&gt; target.addEventListener(event, callback))\n  onUnmounted(() =&gt; target.removeEventListener(event, callback))\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>And now our <code>useMouse()</code> composable can be simplified to:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"mouse.js\">mouse.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref } from 'vue'\nimport { useEventListener } from './event'\n\nexport function useMouse() {\n  const x = ref(0)\n  const y = ref(0)\n\n  useEventListener(window, 'mousemove', (event) =&gt; {\n    x.value = event.pageX\n    y.value = event.pageY\n  })\n\n  return { x, y }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Each component instance calling <code>useMouse()</code> will create its own copies of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> state so they won't interfere with one another. If you want to manage shared state between components, read the <a href=\"../scaling-up/state-management\">State Management</a> chapter.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"async-state-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Async State Example </h2>\n<p>The <code>useMouse()</code> composable doesn't take any arguments, so let's take a look at another example that makes use of one. When doing async data fetching, we often need to handle different states: loading, success, and error:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst data = ref(null)\nconst error = ref(null)\n\nfetch('...')\n  .then((res) =&gt; res.json())\n  .then((json) =&gt; (data.value = json))\n  .catch((err) =&gt; (error.value = err))\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div v-if=\"error\"&gt;Oops! Error encountered: {{ error.message }}&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div v-else-if=\"data\"&gt;\n    Data loaded:\n    &lt;pre&gt;{{ data }}&lt;/pre&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div v-else&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>It would be tedious to have to repeat this pattern in every component that needs to fetch data. Let's extract it into a composable:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"fetch.js\">fetch.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useFetch(url) {\n  const data = ref(null)\n  const error = ref(null)\n\n  fetch(url)\n    .then((res) =&gt; res.json())\n    .then((json) =&gt; (data.value = json))\n    .catch((err) =&gt; (error.value = err))\n\n  return { data, error }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>Now in our component we can just do:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { useFetch } from './fetch.js'\n\nconst { data, error } = useFetch('...')\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"accepting-reactive-state\" tabindex=\"-1\">Accepting Reactive State </h3>\n<p><code>useFetch()</code> takes a static URL string as input - so it performs the fetch only once and is then done. What if we want it to re-fetch whenever the URL changes? In order to achieve this, we need to pass reactive state into the composable function, and let the composable create watchers that perform actions using the passed state.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>useFetch()</code> should be able to accept a ref:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const url = ref('/initial-url')\n\nconst { data, error } = useFetch(url)\n\n// this should trigger a re-fetch\nurl.value = '/new-url'</pre>\n<p>Or, accept a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get#description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">getter function</a>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// re-fetch when props.id changes\nconst { data, error } = useFetch(() =&gt; `/posts/${props.id}`)</pre>\n<p>We can refactor our existing implementation with the <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-core#watcheffect\"><code>watchEffect()</code></a> and <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-utilities#tovalue\"><code>toValue()</code></a> APIs:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"fetch.js\">fetch.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref, watchEffect, toValue } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useFetch(url) {\n  const data = ref(null)\n  const error = ref(null)\n\n  const fetchData = () =&gt; {\n    // reset state before fetching..\n    data.value = null\n    error.value = null\n\n    fetch(toValue(url))\n      .then((res) =&gt; res.json())\n      .then((json) =&gt; (data.value = json))\n      .catch((err) =&gt; (error.value = err))\n  }\n\n  watchEffect(() =&gt; {\n    fetchData()\n  })\n\n  return { data, error }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p><code>toValue()</code> is an API added in 3.3. It is designed to normalize refs or getters into values. If the argument is a ref, it returns the ref's value; if the argument is a function, it will call the function and return its return value. Otherwise, it returns the argument as-is. It works similarly to <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-utilities#unref\"><code>unref()</code></a>, but with special treatment for functions.</p>\n<p>Notice that <code>toValue(url)</code> is called <strong>inside</strong> the <code>watchEffect</code> callback. This ensures that any reactive dependencies accessed during the <code>toValue()</code> normalization are tracked by the watcher.</p>\n<p>This version of <code>useFetch()</code> now accepts static URL strings, refs, and getters, making it much more flexible. The watch effect will run immediately, and will track any dependencies accessed during <code>toValue(url)</code>. If no dependencies are tracked (e.g. url is already a string), the effect runs only once; otherwise, it will re-run whenever a tracked dependency changes.</p>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the updated version of <code>useFetch()</code></a>, with an artificial delay and randomized error for demo purposes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conventions-and-best-practices\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conventions and Best Practices </h2>\n<h3 id=\"naming\" tabindex=\"-1\">Naming </h3>\n<p>It is a convention to name composable functions with camelCase names that start with \"use\".</p>\n<h3 id=\"input-arguments\" tabindex=\"-1\">Input Arguments </h3>\n<p>A composable can accept ref or getter arguments even if it doesn't rely on them for reactivity. If you are writing a composable that may be used by other developers, it's a good idea to handle the case of input arguments being refs or getters instead of raw values. The <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-utilities#tovalue\"><code>toValue()</code></a> utility function will come in handy for this purpose:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { toValue } from 'vue'\n\nfunction useFeature(maybeRefOrGetter) {\n  // If maybeRefOrGetter is a ref or a getter,\n  // its normalized value will be returned.\n  // Otherwise, it is returned as-is.\n  const value = toValue(maybeRefOrGetter)\n}</pre>\n<p>If your composable creates reactive effects when the input is a ref or a getter, make sure to either explicitly watch the ref / getter with <code>watch()</code>, or call <code>toValue()</code> inside a <code>watchEffect()</code> so that it is properly tracked.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"#accepting-reactive-state\">useFetch() implementation discussed earlier</a> provides a concrete example of a composable that accepts refs, getters and plain values as input argument.</p>\n<h3 id=\"return-values\" tabindex=\"-1\">Return Values </h3>\n<p>You have probably noticed that we have been exclusively using <code>ref()</code> instead of <code>reactive()</code> in composables. The recommended convention is for composables to always return a plain, non-reactive object containing multiple refs. This allows it to be destructured in components while retaining reactivity:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// x and y are refs\nconst { x, y } = useMouse()</pre>\n<p>Returning a reactive object from a composable will cause such destructures to lose the reactivity connection to the state inside the composable, while the refs will retain that connection.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to use returned state from composables as object properties, you can wrap the returned object with <code>reactive()</code> so that the refs are unwrapped. For example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const mouse = reactive(useMouse())\n// mouse.x is linked to original ref\nconsole.log(mouse.x)</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">Mouse position is at: {{ mouse.x }}, {{ mouse.y }}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"side-effects\" tabindex=\"-1\">Side Effects </h3>\n<p>It is OK to perform side effects (e.g. adding DOM event listeners or fetching data) in composables, but pay attention to the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you are working on an application that uses <a href=\"../scaling-up/ssr\">Server-Side Rendering</a> (SSR), make sure to perform DOM-specific side effects in post-mount lifecycle hooks, e.g. <code>onMounted()</code>. These hooks are only called in the browser, so you can be sure that code inside them has access to the DOM.</p></li>\n<li><p>Remember to clean up side effects in <code>onUnmounted()</code>. For example, if a composable sets up a DOM event listener, it should remove that listener in <code>onUnmounted()</code> as we have seen in the <code>useMouse()</code> example. It can be a good idea to use a composable that automatically does this for you, like the <code>useEventListener()</code> example.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"usage-restrictions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Usage Restrictions </h3>\n<p>Composables should only be called in <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> or the <code>setup()</code> hook. They should also be called <strong>synchronously</strong> in these contexts. In some cases, you can also call them in lifecycle hooks like <code>onMounted()</code>.</p>\n<p>These restrictions are important because these are the contexts where Vue is able to determine the current active component instance. Access to an active component instance is necessary so that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Lifecycle hooks can be registered to it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Computed properties and watchers can be linked to it, so that they can be disposed when the instance is unmounted to prevent memory leaks.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p><code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> is the only place where you can call composables <strong>after</strong> using <code>await</code>. The compiler automatically restores the active instance context for you after the async operation.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"extracting-composables-for-code-organization\" tabindex=\"-1\">Extracting Composables for Code Organization </h2>\n<p>Composables can be extracted not only for reuse, but also for code organization. As the complexity of your components grows, you may end up with components that are too large to navigate and reason about. Composition API gives you the full flexibility to organize your component code into smaller functions based on logical concerns:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { useFeatureA } from './featureA.js'\nimport { useFeatureB } from './featureB.js'\nimport { useFeatureC } from './featureC.js'\n\nconst { foo, bar } = useFeatureA()\nconst { baz } = useFeatureB(foo)\nconst { qux } = useFeatureC(baz)\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>To some extent, you can think of these extracted composables as component-scoped services that can talk to one another.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-composables-in-options-api\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using Composables in Options API </h2>\n<p>If you are using Options API, composables must be called inside <code>setup()</code>, and the returned bindings must be returned from <code>setup()</code> so that they are exposed to <code>this</code> and the template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { useMouse } from './mouse.js'\nimport { useFetch } from './fetch.js'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const { x, y } = useMouse()\n    const { data, error } = useFetch('...')\n    return { x, y, data, error }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    // setup() exposed properties can be accessed on `this`\n    console.log(this.x)\n  }\n  // ...other options\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"comparisons-with-other-techniques\" tabindex=\"-1\">Comparisons with Other Techniques </h2>\n<h3 id=\"vs-mixins\" tabindex=\"-1\">vs. Mixins </h3>\n<p>Users coming from Vue 2 may be familiar with the <a href=\"../../api/options-composition#mixins\">mixins</a> option, which also allows us to extract component logic into reusable units. There are three primary drawbacks to mixins:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Unclear source of properties</strong>: when using many mixins, it becomes unclear which instance property is injected by which mixin, making it difficult to trace the implementation and understand the component's behavior. This is also why we recommend using the refs + destructure pattern for composables: it makes the property source clear in consuming components.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Namespace collisions</strong>: multiple mixins from different authors can potentially register the same property keys, causing namespace collisions. With composables, you can rename the destructured variables if there are conflicting keys from different composables.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Implicit cross-mixin communication</strong>: multiple mixins that need to interact with one another have to rely on shared property keys, making them implicitly coupled. With composables, values returned from one composable can be passed into another as arguments, just like normal functions.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the above reasons, we no longer recommend using mixins in Vue 3. The feature is kept only for migration and familiarity reasons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vs-renderless-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">vs. Renderless Components </h3>\n<p>In the component slots chapter, we discussed the <a href=\"../components/slots#renderless-components\">Renderless Component</a> pattern based on scoped slots. We even implemented the same mouse tracking demo using renderless components.</p>\n<p>The main advantage of composables over renderless components is that composables do not incur the extra component instance overhead. When used across an entire application, the amount of extra component instances created by the renderless component pattern can become a noticeable performance overhead.</p>\n<p>The recommendation is to use composables when reusing pure logic, and use components when reusing both logic and visual layout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vs-react-hooks\" tabindex=\"-1\">vs. React Hooks </h3>\n<p>If you have experience with React, you may notice that this looks very similar to custom React hooks. Composition API was in part inspired by React hooks, and Vue composables are indeed similar to React hooks in terms of logic composition capabilities. However, Vue composables are based on Vue's fine-grained reactivity system, which is fundamentally different from React hooks' execution model.

This is how we install a plugin:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { createApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createApp({})\n\napp.use(myPlugin, {\n  /* optional options */\n})</pre>\n<p>A plugin is defined as either an object that exposes an <code>install()</code> method, or simply a function that acts as the install function itself. The install function receives the <a href=\"../../api/application\">app instance</a> along with additional options passed to <code>app.use()</code>, if any:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const myPlugin = {\n  install(app, options) {\n    // configure the app\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>There is no strictly defined scope for a plugin, but common scenarios where plugins are useful include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Register one or more global components or custom directives with <a href=\"../../api/application#app-component\"><code>app.component()</code></a> and <a href=\"../../api/application#app-directive\"><code>app.directive()</code></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make a resource <a href=\"../components/provide-inject\">injectable</a> throughout the app by calling <a href=\"../../api/application#app-provide\"><code>app.provide()</code></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Add some global instance properties or methods by attaching them to <a href=\"../../api/application#app-config-globalproperties\"><code>app.config.globalProperties</code></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>A library that needs to perform some combination of the above (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">vue-router</a>).</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"writing-a-plugin\" tabindex=\"-1\">Writing a Plugin </h2>\n<p>In order to better understand how to create your own Vue.js plugins, we will create a very simplified version of a plugin that displays <code>i18n</code> (short for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Internationalization</a>) strings.</p>\n<p>Let's begin by setting up the plugin object. It is recommended to create it in a separate file and export it, as shown below to keep the logic contained and separate.</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"plugins/i18n.js\">plugins/i18n.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  install: (app, options) =&gt; {\n    // Plugin code goes here\n  }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>We want to create a translation function. This function will receive a dot-delimited <code>key</code> string, which we will use to look up the translated string in the user-provided options. This is the intended usage in templates:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;h1&gt;{{ $translate('greetings.hello') }}&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>\n<p>Since this function should be globally available in all templates, we will make it so by attaching it to <code>app.config.globalProperties</code> in our plugin:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"plugins/i18n.js\">plugins/i18n.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  install: (app, options) =&gt; {\n    // inject a globally available $translate() method\n    app.config.globalProperties.$translate = (key) =&gt; {\n      // retrieve a nested property in `options`\n      // using `key` as the path\n      return key.split('.').reduce((o, i) =&gt; {\n        if (o) return o[i]\n      }, options)\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>Our <code>$translate</code> function will take a string such as <code>greetings.hello</code>, look inside the user provided configuration and return the translated value.</p>\n<p>The object containing the translated keys should be passed to the plugin during installation via additional parameters to <code>app.use()</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import i18nPlugin from './plugins/i18n'\n\napp.use(i18nPlugin, {\n  greetings: {\n    hello: 'Bonjour!'\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>Now, our initial expression <code>$translate('greetings.hello')</code> will be replaced by <code>Bonjour!</code> at runtime.</p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"../typescript/options-api#augmenting-global-properties\">Augmenting Global Properties</a> </p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Use global properties scarcely, since it can quickly become confusing if too many global properties injected by different plugins are used throughout an app.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"provide-inject-with-plugins\" tabindex=\"-1\">Provide / Inject with Plugins </h3>\n<p>Plugins also allow us to use <code>provide</code> to give plugin users access to a function or attribute.

First, we render the index of an item as a data attribute on the DOM element:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;TransitionGroup\n  tag=\"ul\"\n  :css=\"false\"\n  @before-enter=\"onBeforeEnter\"\n  @enter=\"onEnter\"\n  @leave=\"onLeave\"\n&gt;\n  &lt;li\n    v-for=\"(item, index) in computedList\"\n    :key=\"item.msg\"\n    :data-index=\"index\"\n  &gt;\n    {{ item.msg }}\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/TransitionGroup&gt;</pre>\n<p>Then, in JavaScript hooks, we animate the element with a delay based on the data attribute. This example is using the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GSAP library</a> to perform the animation:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function onEnter(el, done) {\n  gsap.to(el, {\n    opacity: 1,\n    height: '1.6em',\n    delay: el.dataset.index * 0.15,\n    onComplete: done\n  })\n}</pre>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqlVMuu0zAQ/ZVRNklRm7QLWETtBW4FSFCxYkdYmGSSmjp28KNQVfl3xk7SFyvEponPGc+cOTPNOXrbdenRYZRHa1Nq3lkwaF33VEjedkpbOIPGeg6lajtnsYIeaq1aiOlSfAlqDOtG3L8SUchSSWNBcPrZwNdCAqVqTZND/KxdibBDjKGf3xIfWXngCNs9k4/Udu/KA3xWWnPz1zW0sOOP6CcnG3jv9ImIQn67SvrpUJ9IE/WVxPHsSkw97gbN0zFJZrB5grNPrskcLUNXac2FRZ0k3GIbIvxLSsVTq3bqF+otM5jMUi5L4So0SSicHplwOKOyfShdO1lariQo+Yy10vhO+qwoZkNFFKmxJ4Gp6ljJrRe+vMP3yJu910swNXqXcco1h0pJHDP6CZHEAAcAYMydwypYCDAkJRdX6Sts4xGtUDAKotIVs9Scpd4q/A0vYJmuXo5BSm7JOIEW81DVo77VR207ZEf8F23LB23T+X9VrbNh82nn6UAz7ASzSCeANZe0AnBctIqqbIoojLCIIBvoL5pJw31DH7Ry3VDKsoYinSii4ZyXxhBQM2Fwwt58D7NeoB8QkXfDvwRd2XtceOsCHkwc8KCINAk+vADJppQUFjZ0DsGVGT3uFn1KSjoPeKLoaYtvCO/rIlz3vH9O5FiU/nXny/pDT6YGKZngg0/Zg1GErrMbp6N5NHxJFi3N/4dRkj5IYf5ULxCmiPJpI4rIr4kHimhvbWfyLHOyOzQpNZZ57jXNy4nRGFLTR/0fWBqe7w==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Full Example in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Full Example in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Related</strong></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"../../api/built-in-components#transitiongroup\"><code>&lt;TransitionGroup&gt;</code> API reference</a></li></ul><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition-group\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition-group</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/built-ins/keep-alive":"<h1 id=\"keepalive\" tabindex=\"-1\">KeepAlive </h1>\n<p><code>&lt;KeepAlive&gt;</code> is a built-in component that allows us to conditionally cache component instances when dynamically switching between multiple components.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basic-usage\" tabindex=\"-1\">Basic Usage </h2>\n<p>In the Component Basics chapter, we introduced the syntax for <a href=\"../essentials/component-basics#dynamic-components\">Dynamic Components</a>, using the <code>&lt;component&gt;</code> special element:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;component :is=\"activeComponent\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>By default, an active component instance will be unmounted when switching away from it.

Try updating the state of one of them, switch away, and then switch back to it:</p>\n<p>You'll notice that when switched back, the previous changed state would have been reset.</p>\n<p>Creating fresh component instance on switch is normally useful behavior, but in this case, we'd really like the two component instances to be preserved even when they are inactive.

This can create some tricky issues when positioning the modal via CSS.</p>\n<p>Consider the following HTML structure.</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div class=\"outer\"&gt;\n  &lt;h3&gt;Vue Teleport Example&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;MyModal /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>And here is the implementation of <code>&lt;MyModal&gt;</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst open = ref(false)\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"open = true\"&gt;Open Modal&lt;/button&gt;\n\n  &lt;div v-if=\"open\" class=\"modal\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Hello from the modal!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button @click=\"open = false\"&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;style scoped&gt;\n.modal {\n  position: fixed;\n  z-index: 999;\n  top: 20%;\n  left: 50%;\n  width: 300px;\n  margin-left: -150px;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      open: false\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"open = true\"&gt;Open Modal&lt;/button&gt;\n\n  &lt;div v-if=\"open\" class=\"modal\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Hello from the modal!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button @click=\"open = false\"&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;style scoped&gt;\n.modal {\n  position: fixed;\n  z-index: 999;\n  top: 20%;\n  left: 50%;\n  width: 300px;\n  margin-left: -150px;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre></div>\n<p>The component contains a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> to trigger the opening of the modal, and a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with a class of <code>.modal</code>, which will contain the modal's content and a button to self-close.</p>\n<p>When using this component inside the initial HTML structure, there are a number of potential issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>position: fixed</code> only places the element relative to the viewport when no ancestor element has <code>transform</code>, <code>perspective</code> or <code>filter</code> property set. If, for example, we intend to animate the ancestor <code>&lt;div class=\"outer\"&gt;</code> with a CSS transform, it would break the modal layout!</p></li>\n<li><p>The modal's <code>z-index</code> is constrained by its containing elements. If there is another element that overlaps with <code>&lt;div class=\"outer\"&gt;</code> and has a higher <code>z-index</code>, it would cover our modal.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> provides a clean way to work around these, by allowing us to break out of the nested DOM structure. Let's modify <code>&lt;MyModal&gt;</code> to use <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;button @click=\"open = true\"&gt;Open Modal&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;Teleport to=\"body\"&gt;\n  &lt;div v-if=\"open\" class=\"modal\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Hello from the modal!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button @click=\"open = false\"&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/Teleport&gt;</pre>\n<p>The <code>to</code> target of <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> expects a CSS selector string or an actual DOM node. Here, we are essentially telling Vue to \"<strong>teleport</strong> this template fragment <strong>to</strong> the <strong><code>body</code></strong> tag\".</p>\n<p>You can click the button below and inspect the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag via your browser's devtools:</p>\n<p>You can combine <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> with <a href=\"transition\"><code>&lt;Transition&gt;</code></a> to create animated modals - see <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/examples/#modal\">Example here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>The teleport <code>to</code> target must be already in the DOM when the <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> component is mounted. Ideally, this should be an element outside the entire Vue application. If targeting another element rendered by Vue, you need to make sure that element is mounted before the <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"using-with-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using with Components </h2>\n<p><code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> only alters the rendered DOM structure - it does not affect the logical hierarchy of the components. That is to say, if <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> contains a component, that component will remain a logical child of the parent component containing the <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code>. Props passing and event emitting will continue to work the same way.</p>\n<p>This also means that injections from a parent component work as expected, and that the child component will be nested below the parent component in the Vue Devtools, instead of being placed where the actual content moved to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disabling-teleport\" tabindex=\"-1\">Disabling Teleport </h2>\n<p>In some cases, we may want to conditionally disable <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code>. For example, we may want to render a component as an overlay for desktop, but inline on mobile. <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> supports the <code>disabled</code> prop which can be dynamically toggled:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Teleport :disabled=\"isMobile\"&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/Teleport&gt;</pre>\n<p>We could then dynamically update <code>isMobile</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiple-teleports-on-the-same-target\" tabindex=\"-1\">Multiple Teleports on the Same Target </h2>\n<p>A common use case would be a reusable <code>&lt;Modal&gt;</code> component, with the potential for multiple instances to be active at the same time. For this kind of scenario, multiple <code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> components can mount their content to the same target element. The order will be a simple append, with later mounts located after earlier ones, but all within the target element.</p>\n<p>Given the following usage:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Teleport to=\"#modals\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;A&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/Teleport&gt;\n&lt;Teleport to=\"#modals\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;B&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/Teleport&gt;</pre>\n<p>The rendered result would be:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"html\">&lt;div id=\"modals\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;A&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;B&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<h2 id=\"deferred-teleport\" tabindex=\"-1\">Deferred Teleport  </h2>\n<p>In Vue 3.5 and above, we can use the <code>defer</code> prop to defer the target resolving of a Teleport until other parts of the application have mounted. This allows the Teleport to target a container element that is rendered by Vue, but in a later part of the component tree:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Teleport defer to=\"#late-div\"&gt;...&lt;/Teleport&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- somewhere later in the template --&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"late-div\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>Note that the target element must be rendered in the same mount / update tick with the Teleport - i.e. if the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is only mounted a second later, the Teleport will still report an error. The defer works similarly to the <code>mounted</code> lifecycle hook.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Related</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../../api/built-in-components#teleport\"><code>&lt;Teleport&gt;</code> API reference</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../scaling-up/ssr#teleports\">Handling Teleports in SSR</a></li>\n</ul><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/teleport\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/teleport</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/built-ins/suspense":"<h1 id=\"suspense\" tabindex=\"-1\">Suspense </h1>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Experimental Feature</strong><p><code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> is an experimental feature. It is not guaranteed to reach stable status and the API may change before it does.</p>\n</div>\n<p><code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> is a built-in component for orchestrating async dependencies in a component tree. It can render a loading state while waiting for multiple nested async dependencies down the component tree to be resolved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"async-dependencies\" tabindex=\"-1\">Async Dependencies </h2>\n<p>To explain the problem <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> is trying to solve and how it interacts with these async dependencies, let's imagine a component hierarchy like the following:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"\">&lt;Suspense&gt;\n└─ &lt;Dashboard&gt;\n   ├─ &lt;Profile&gt;\n   │  └─ &lt;FriendStatus&gt; (component with async setup())\n   └─ &lt;Content&gt;\n      ├─ &lt;ActivityFeed&gt; (async component)\n      └─ &lt;Stats&gt; (async component)</pre>\n<p>In the component tree there are multiple nested components whose rendering depends on some async resource to be resolved first. Without <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code>, each of them will need to handle its own loading / error and loaded states. In the worst case scenario, we may see three loading spinners on the page, with content displayed at different times.</p>\n<p>The <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> component gives us the ability to display top-level loading / error states while we wait on these nested async dependencies to be resolved.</p>\n<p>There are two types of async dependencies that <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> can wait on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Components with an async <code>setup()</code> hook. This includes components using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> with top-level <code>await</code> expressions.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"../components/async\">Async Components</a>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"async-setup\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<code>async setup()</code> </h3>\n<p>A Composition API component's <code>setup()</code> hook can be async:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  async setup() {\n    const res = await fetch(...)\n    const posts = await res.json()\n    return {\n      posts\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>If using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, the presence of top-level <code>await</code> expressions automatically makes the component an async dependency:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nconst res = await fetch(...)\nconst posts = await res.json()\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  {{ posts }}\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"async-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Async Components </h3>\n<p>Async components are <strong>\"suspensible\"</strong> by default. This means that if it has a <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> in the parent chain, it will be treated as an async dependency of that <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code>. In this case, the loading state will be controlled by the <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code>, and the component's own loading, error, delay and timeout options will be ignored.</p>\n<p>The async component can opt-out of <code>Suspense</code> control and let the component always control its own loading state by specifying <code>suspensible: false</code> in its options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"loading-state\" tabindex=\"-1\">Loading State </h2>\n<p>The <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> component has two slots: <code>#default</code> and <code>#fallback</code>. Both slots only allow for <strong>one</strong> immediate child node. The node in the default slot is shown if possible. If not, the node in the fallback slot will be shown instead.</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Suspense&gt;\n  &lt;!-- component with nested async dependencies --&gt;\n  &lt;Dashboard /&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- loading state via #fallback slot --&gt;\n  &lt;template #fallback&gt;\n    Loading...\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/Suspense&gt;</pre>\n<p>On initial render, <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> will render its default slot content in memory. If any async dependencies are encountered during the process, it will enter a <strong>pending</strong> state. During the pending state, the fallback content will be displayed. When all encountered async dependencies have been resolved, <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> enters a <strong>resolved</strong> state and the resolved default slot content is displayed.</p>\n<p>If no async dependencies were encountered during the initial render, <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> will directly go into a resolved state.</p>\n<p>Once in a resolved state, <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> will only revert to a pending state if the root node of the <code>#default</code> slot is replaced. New async dependencies nested deeper in the tree will <strong>not</strong> cause the <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> to revert to a pending state.</p>\n<p>When a revert happens, fallback content will not be immediately displayed. Instead, <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> will display the previous <code>#default</code> content while waiting for the new content and its async dependencies to be resolved. This behavior can be configured with the <code>timeout</code> prop: <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> will switch to fallback content if it takes longer than <code>timeout</code> milliseconds to render the new default content. A <code>timeout</code> value of <code>0</code> will cause the fallback content to be displayed immediately when default content is replaced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"events\" tabindex=\"-1\">Events </h2>\n<p>The <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> component emits 3 events: <code>pending</code>, <code>resolve</code> and <code>fallback</code>. The <code>pending</code> event occurs when entering a pending state. The <code>resolve</code> event is emitted when new content has finished resolving in the <code>default</code> slot. The <code>fallback</code> event is fired when the contents of the <code>fallback</code> slot are shown.</p>\n<p>The events could be used, for example, to show a loading indicator in front of the old DOM while new components are loading.</p>\n<h2 id=\"error-handling\" tabindex=\"-1\">Error Handling </h2>\n<p><code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> currently does not provide error handling via the component itself - however, you can use the <a href=\"../../api/options-lifecycle#errorcaptured\"><code>errorCaptured</code></a> option or the <a href=\"../../api/composition-api-lifecycle#onerrorcaptured\"><code>onErrorCaptured()</code></a> hook to capture and handle async errors in the parent component of <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"combining-with-other-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Combining with Other Components </h2>\n<p>It is common to want to use <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> in combination with the <a href=\"transition\"><code>&lt;Transition&gt;</code></a> and <a href=\"keep-alive\"><code>&lt;KeepAlive&gt;</code></a> components. The nesting order of these components is important to get them all working correctly.</p>\n<p>In addition, these components are often used in conjunction with the <code>&lt;RouterView&gt;</code> component from <a href=\"https://router.vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue Router</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows how to nest these components so that they all behave as expected. For simpler combinations you can remove the components that you don't need:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;RouterView v-slot=\"{ Component }\"&gt;\n  &lt;template v-if=\"Component\"&gt;\n    &lt;Transition mode=\"out-in\"&gt;\n      &lt;KeepAlive&gt;\n        &lt;Suspense&gt;\n          &lt;!-- main content --&gt;\n          &lt;component :is=\"Component\"&gt;&lt;/component&gt;\n\n          &lt;!-- loading state --&gt;\n          &lt;template #fallback&gt;\n            Loading...\n          &lt;/template&gt;\n        &lt;/Suspense&gt;\n      &lt;/KeepAlive&gt;\n    &lt;/Transition&gt;\n  &lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;/RouterView&gt;</pre>\n<p>Vue Router has built-in support for <a href=\"https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lazily loading components</a> using dynamic imports. These are distinct from async components and currently they will not trigger <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code>. However, they can still have async components as descendants and those can trigger <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> in the usual way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nested-suspense\" tabindex=\"-1\">Nested Suspense </h2>\n<ul><li>Only supported in 3.3+</li></ul>\n<p>When we have multiple async components (common for nested or layout-based routes) like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Suspense&gt;\n  &lt;component :is=\"DynamicAsyncOuter\"&gt;\n    &lt;component :is=\"DynamicAsyncInner\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/component&gt;\n&lt;/Suspense&gt;</pre>\n<p><code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> creates a boundary that will resolve all the async components down the tree, as expected. However, when we change <code>DynamicAsyncOuter</code>, <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> awaits it correctly, but when we change <code>DynamicAsyncInner</code>, the nested <code>DynamicAsyncInner</code> renders an empty node until it has been resolved (instead of the previous one or fallback slot).</p>\n<p>In order to solve that, we could have a nested suspense to handle the patch for the nested component, like:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Suspense&gt;\n  &lt;component :is=\"DynamicAsyncOuter\"&gt;\n    &lt;Suspense suspensible&gt; &lt;!-- this --&gt;\n      &lt;component :is=\"DynamicAsyncInner\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/Suspense&gt;\n  &lt;/component&gt;\n&lt;/Suspense&gt;</pre>\n<p>If you don't set the <code>suspensible</code> prop, the inner <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> will be treated like a sync component by the parent <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code>. That means that it has its own fallback slot and if both <code>Dynamic</code> components change at the same time, there might be empty nodes and multiple patching cycles while the child <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> is loading its own dependency tree, which might not be desirable. When it's set, all the async dependency handling is given to the parent <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> (including the events emitted) and the inner <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> serves solely as another boundary for the dependency resolution and patching.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Related</strong></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"../../api/built-in-components#suspense\"><code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> API reference</a></li></ul><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/suspense</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/scaling-up/sfc":"<h1 id=\"single-file-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Single-File Components </h1>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\" tabindex=\"-1\">Introduction </h2>\n<p>Vue Single-File Components (a.k.a. <code>*.vue</code> files, abbreviated as <strong>SFC</strong>) is a special file format that allows us to encapsulate the template, logic, <strong>and</strong> styling of a Vue component in a single file. Here's an example SFC:</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      greeting: 'Hello World!'\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"greeting\"&gt;{{ greeting }}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n.greeting {\n  color: red;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre></div>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nconst greeting = ref('Hello World!')\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"greeting\"&gt;{{ greeting }}&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n.greeting {\n  color: red;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre></div>\n<p>As we can see, Vue SFC is a natural extension of the classic trio of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> blocks encapsulate and colocate the view, logic and styling of a component in the same file. The full syntax is defined in the <a href=\"../../api/sfc-spec\">SFC Syntax Specification</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-sfc\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why SFC </h2>\n<p>While SFCs require a build step, there are numerous benefits in return:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Author modularized components using familiar HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax</li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-about-separation-of-concerns\">Colocation of inherently coupled concerns</a></li>\n<li>Pre-compiled templates without runtime compilation cost</li>\n<li><a href=\"../../api/sfc-css-features\">Component-scoped CSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../api/sfc-script-setup\">More ergonomic syntax when working with Composition API</a></li>\n<li>More compile-time optimizations by cross-analyzing template and script</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"tooling#ide-support\">IDE support</a> with auto-completion and type-checking for template expressions</li>\n<li>Out-of-the-box Hot-Module Replacement (HMR) support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SFC is a defining feature of Vue as a framework, and is the recommended approach for using Vue in the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single-Page Applications (SPA)</li>\n<li>Static Site Generation (SSG)</li>\n<li>Any non-trivial frontend where a build step can be justified for better development experience (DX).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, we do realize there are scenarios where SFCs can feel like overkill. This is why Vue can still be used via plain JavaScript without a build step.

A compiled SFC is a standard JavaScript (ES) module - which means with proper build setup you can import an SFC like a module:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    MyComponent\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p><code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags inside SFCs are typically injected as native <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags during development to support hot updates. For production they can be extracted and merged into a single CSS file.</p>\n<p>You can play with SFCs and explore how they are compiled in the <a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue SFC Playground</a>.</p>\n<p>In actual projects, we typically integrate the SFC compiler with a build tool such as <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vite</a> or <a href=\"http://cli.vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue CLI</a> (which is based on <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">webpack</a>), and Vue provides official scaffolding tools to get you started with SFCs as fast as possible. Check out more details in the <a href=\"tooling\">SFC Tooling</a> section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-about-separation-of-concerns\" tabindex=\"-1\">What About Separation of Concerns? </h2>\n<p>Some users coming from a traditional web development background may have the concern that SFCs are mixing different concerns in the same place - which HTML/CSS/JS were supposed to separate!</p>\n<p>To answer this question, it is important for us to agree that <strong>separation of concerns is not equal to the separation of file types</strong>. The ultimate goal of engineering principles is to improve the maintainability of codebases. Separation of concerns, when applied dogmatically as separation of file types, does not help us reach that goal in the context of increasingly complex frontend applications.</p>\n<p>In modern UI development, we have found that instead of dividing the codebase into three huge layers that interweave with one another, it makes much more sense to divide them into loosely-coupled components and compose them. Inside a component, its template, logic, and styles are inherently coupled, and colocating them actually makes the component more cohesive and maintainable.</p>\n<p>Note even if you don't like the idea of Single-File Components, you can still leverage its hot-reloading and pre-compilation features by separating your JavaScript and CSS into separate files using <a href=\"../../api/sfc-spec#src-imports\">Src Imports</a>.</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/scaling-up/state-management":"<h1 id=\"state-management\" tabindex=\"-1\">State Management </h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-state-management\" tabindex=\"-1\">What is State Management? </h2>\n<p>Technically, every Vue component instance already \"manages\" its own reactive state.

width=\"252px\" style=\"margin:40px auto;\"></p>\n<p>However, the simplicity starts to break down when we have <strong>multiple components that share a common state</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Multiple views may depend on the same piece of state.</li>\n<li>Actions from different views may need to mutate the same piece of state.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For case one, a possible workaround is by \"lifting\" the shared state up to a common ancestor component, and then pass it down as props. However, this quickly gets tedious in component trees with deep hierarchies, leading to another problem known as <a href=\"../components/provide-inject#prop-drilling\">Prop Drilling</a>.</p>\n<p>For case two, we often find ourselves resorting to solutions such as reaching for direct parent / child instances via template refs, or trying to mutate and synchronize multiple copies of the state via emitted events. Both of these patterns are brittle and quickly lead to unmaintainable code.</p>\n<p>A simpler and more straightforward solution is to extract the shared state out of the components, and manage it in a global singleton.

It can either be <code>transitionend</code> or <code>animationend</code>, depending on the type of CSS rules applied. If you are only using one or the other, Vue can automatically detect the correct type.</p>\n<p>However, in some cases you may want to have both on the same element, for example having a CSS animation triggered by Vue, along with a CSS transition effect on hover. In these cases, you will have to explicitly declare the type you want Vue to care about by passing the <code>type</code> prop, with a value of either <code>animation</code> or <code>transition</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Transition type=\"animation\"&gt;...&lt;/Transition&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"nested-transitions-and-explicit-transition-durations\" tabindex=\"-1\">Nested Transitions and Explicit Transition Durations </h3>\n<p>Although the transition classes are only applied to the direct child element in <code>&lt;Transition&gt;</code>, we can transition nested elements using nested CSS selectors:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Transition name=\"nested\"&gt;\n  &lt;div v-if=\"show\" class=\"outer\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"inner\"&gt;\n      Hello\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/Transition&gt;</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"css\">/* rules that target nested elements */\n.nested-enter-active .inner,\n.nested-leave-active .inner {\n  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.nested-enter-from .inner,\n.nested-leave-to .inner {\n  transform: translateX(30px);\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n\n/* ... other necessary CSS omitted */</pre>\n<p>We can even add a transition delay to the nested element on enter, which creates a staggered enter animation sequence:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"css\">/* delay enter of nested element for staggered effect */\n.nested-enter-active .inner {\n  transition-delay: 0.25s;\n}</pre>\n<p>However, this creates a small issue. By default, the <code>&lt;Transition&gt;</code> component attempts to automatically figure out when the transition has finished by listening to the <strong>first</strong> <code>transitionend</code> or <code>animationend</code> event on the root transition element. With a nested transition, the desired behavior should be waiting until the transitions of all inner elements have finished.</p>\n<p>In such cases you can specify an explicit transition duration (in milliseconds) using the <code>duration</code> prop on the <code>&lt;Transition&gt;</code> component. The total duration should match the delay plus transition duration of the inner element:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Transition :duration=\"550\"&gt;...&lt;/Transition&gt;</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqVVd9v0zAQ/leO8LAfrE3HNKSFbgKmSYMHQNAHkPLiOtfEm2NHttN2mvq/c7bTNi1jgFop9t13d9995ziPyfumGc5bTLJkbLkRjQOLrm2uciXqRhsHj2BwBiuYGV3DAUEPcpUrrpUlaKUXcOkBh860eJSrcRqzUDxtHNaNZA5pBzCets5pBe+4FPz+Mk+66Bf+mSdXE12WEsdphMWQiWHKCicoLCtaw/yKIs/PR3kCitVIG4XWYUEJfATFFGIO84GYdRUIyCWzlra6dWg2wA66dgqlts7c+d8tSqk34JTQ6xqb9TjdUiTDOO21TFvrHqRfDkPpExiGKvBITjdl/L40ulVFBi8R8a3P17CiEKrM4GzULIOlFmpQoSgrl8HpKFpX3kFZu2y0BNhJxznvwaJCA1TEYcC4E3MkKp1VIptjZ43E3KajDJiUMBqeWUBmcUBUqJGYOT2GAiV7gJAA9Iy4GyoBKLH2z+N0W3q/CMC2yCCkyajM63Mbc+9z9mfvZD+b071MM23qLC69+j8PvX5HQUDdMC6cL7BOTtQXCJwpas/qHhWIBdYtWGgtDWNttWTmThu701pf1W6+v1Hd8Xbz+k+VQxmv8i7Fv1HZn+g/iv2nRkjzbd6npf/Rkz49DifQ3dLZBBYOJzC4rqgCwsUbmLYlCAUVU4XsCd1NrCeRHcYXb1IJC/RX2hEYCwJTvHYVMZoavbBI09FmU+LiFSzIh0AIXy1mqZiFKaKCmVhiEVJ7GftHZTganUZ56EYLL3FykjhL195MlMM7qxXdmEGDPOG6boRE86UJVPMki+p4H01WLz4Fm78hSdBo5xXy+yfsd3bpbXny1SA1M8c82fgcMyW66L75/hmXtN44a120ktDPOL+h1bL1HCPsA42DaPdwge3HcO/TOCb2ZumQJtA15Yl65Crg84S+BdfPtL6lezY8C3GkZ7L6Bc1zNR0=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p>\n<p>If necessary, you can also specify separate values for enter and leave durations using an object:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Transition :duration=\"{ enter: 500, leave: 800 }\"&gt;...&lt;/Transition&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"performance-considerations\" tabindex=\"-1\">Performance Considerations </h3>\n<p>You may notice that the animations shown above are mostly using properties like <code>transform</code> and <code>opacity</code>.

This explicitly tells Vue to skip auto CSS transition detection. Aside from being slightly more performant, this also prevents CSS rules from accidentally interfering with the transition:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Transition\n  ...\n  :css=\"false\"\n&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/Transition&gt;</pre>\n<p>With <code>:css=\"false\"</code>, we are also fully responsible for controlling when the transition ends. In this case, the <code>done</code> callbacks are required for the <code>@enter</code> and <code>@leave</code> hooks.

It allows us to dynamically apply different transitions based on state change:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;Transition :name=\"transitionName\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n&lt;/Transition&gt;</pre>\n<p>This can be useful when you've defined CSS transitions / animations using Vue's transition class conventions and want to switch between them.</p>\n<p>You can also apply different behavior in JavaScript transition hooks based on the current state of your component. Finally, the ultimate way of creating dynamic transitions is through <a href=\"#reusable-transitions\">reusable transition components</a> that accept props to change the nature of the transition(s) to be used. It may sound cheesy, but the only limit really is your imagination.</p>\n<h2 id=\"transitions-with-the-key-attribute\" tabindex=\"-1\">Transitions with the Key Attribute </h2>\n<p>Sometimes you need to force the re-render of a DOM element in order for a transition to occur.</p>\n<p>Take this counter component for example:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\nconst count = ref(0);\n\nsetInterval(() =&gt; count.value++, 1000);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;Transition&gt;\n    &lt;span :key=\"count\"&gt;{{ count }}&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/Transition&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 1,\n      interval: null \n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {\n      this.count++;\n    }, 1000)\n  },\n  beforeDestroy() {\n    clearInterval(this.interval)\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;Transition&gt;\n    &lt;span :key=\"count\"&gt;{{ count }}&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/Transition&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre></div>\n<p>If we had excluded the <code>key</code> attribute, only the text node would be updated and thus no transition would occur. However, with the <code>key</code> attribute in place, Vue knows to create a new <code>span</code> element whenever <code>count</code> changes and thus the <code>Transition</code> component has 2 different elements to transition between.</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p></div>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Related</strong></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"../../api/built-in-components#transition\"><code>&lt;Transition&gt;</code> API reference</a></li></ul><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/scaling-up/testing":"<h1 id=\"testing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Testing </h1>\n<h2 id=\"why-test\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why Test? </h2>\n<p>Automated tests help you and your team build complex Vue applications quickly and confidently by preventing regressions and encouraging you to break apart your application into testable functions, modules, classes, and components. As with any application, your new Vue app can break in many ways, and it's important that you can catch these issues and fix them before releasing.</p>\n<p>In this guide, we'll cover basic terminology and provide our recommendations on which tools to choose for your Vue 3 application.</p>\n<p>There is one Vue-specific section covering composables. See <a href=\"#testing-composables\">Testing Composables</a> below for more details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-test\" tabindex=\"-1\">When to Test </h2>\n<p>Start testing early! We recommend you begin writing tests as soon as you can. The longer you wait to add tests to your application, the more dependencies your application will have, and the harder it will be to start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-types\" tabindex=\"-1\">Testing Types </h2>\n<p>When designing your Vue application's testing strategy, you should leverage the following testing types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Unit</strong>: Checks that inputs to a given function, class, or composable are producing the expected output or side effects.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Component</strong>: Checks that your component mounts, renders, can be interacted with, and behaves as expected. These tests import more code than unit tests, are more complex, and require more time to execute.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>End-to-end</strong>: Checks features that span multiple pages and makes real network requests against your production-built Vue application. These tests often involve standing up a database or other backend.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each testing type plays a role in your application's testing strategy, and each will protect you against different types of issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview\" tabindex=\"-1\">Overview </h2>\n<p>We will briefly discuss what each of these are, how they can be implemented for Vue applications, and provide some general recommendations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unit-testing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Unit Testing </h2>\n<p>Unit tests are written to verify that small, isolated units of code are working as expected. A unit test usually covers a single function, class, composable, or module. Unit tests focus on logical correctness and only concern themselves with a small portion of the application's overall functionality. They may mock large parts of your application's environment (e.g. initial state, complex classes, 3rd party modules, and network requests).</p>\n<p>In general, unit tests will catch issues with a function's business logic and logical correctness.</p>\n<p>Take for example this <code>increment</code> function:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"helpers.js\">helpers.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export function increment(current, max = 10) {\n  if (current &lt; max) {\n    return current + 1\n  }\n  return current\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>Because it's very self-contained, it'll be easy to invoke the increment function and assert that it returns what it's supposed to, so we'll write a Unit Test.</p>\n<p>If any of these assertions fail, it's clear that the issue is contained within the <code>increment</code> function.</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"helpers.spec.js\">helpers.spec.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { increment } from './helpers'\n\ndescribe('increment', () =&gt; {\n  test('increments the current number by 1', () =&gt; {\n    expect(increment(0, 10)).toBe(1)\n  })\n\n  test('does not increment the current number over the max', () =&gt; {\n    expect(increment(10, 10)).toBe(10)\n  })\n\n  test('has a default max of 10', () =&gt; {\n    expect(increment(10)).toBe(10)\n  })\n})</pre>\n</div>\n<p>As mentioned previously, unit testing is typically applied to self-contained business logic, components, classes, modules, or functions that do not involve UI rendering, network requests, or other environmental concerns.</p>\n<p>These are typically plain JavaScript / TypeScript modules unrelated to Vue. In general, writing unit tests for business logic in Vue applications does not differ significantly from applications using other frameworks.</p>\n<p>There are two instances where you DO unit test Vue-specific features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Composables</li>\n<li>Components</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"composables\" tabindex=\"-1\">Composables </h3>\n<p>One category of functions specific to Vue applications is <a href=\"../reusability/composables\">Composables</a>, which may require special handling during tests. See <a href=\"#testing-composables\">Testing Composables</a> below for more details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unit-testing-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Unit Testing Components </h3>\n<p>A component can be tested in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Whitebox: Unit Testing</p>\n<p>Tests that are \"Whitebox tests\" are aware of the implementation details and dependencies of a component. They are focused on <strong>isolating</strong> the component under test. These tests will usually involve mocking some, if not all of your component's children, as well as setting up plugin state and dependencies (e.g. Pinia).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Blackbox: Component Testing</p>\n<p>Tests that are \"Blackbox tests\" are unaware of the implementation details of a component. These tests mock as little as possible to test the integration of your component and the entire system. They usually render all child components and are considered more of an \"integration test\". See the <a href=\"#component-testing\">Component Testing recommendations</a> below.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"recommendation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Recommendation </h3>\n<ul><li>\n<p><a href=\"https://vitest.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vitest</a></p>\n<p>Since the official setup created by <code>create-vue</code> is based on <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vite</a>, we recommend using a unit testing framework that can leverage the same configuration and transform pipeline directly from Vite. <a href=\"https://vitest.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vitest</a> is a unit testing framework designed specifically for this purpose, created and maintained by Vue / Vite team members. It integrates with Vite-based projects with minimal effort, and is blazing fast.</p>\n</li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"other-options\" tabindex=\"-1\">Other Options </h3>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jest</a> is a popular unit testing framework. However, we only recommend Jest if you have an existing Jest test suite that needs to be migrated over to a Vite-based project, as Vitest offers a more seamless integration and better performance.</li></ul>\n<h2 id=\"component-testing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Component Testing </h2>\n<p>In Vue applications, components are the main building blocks of the UI. Components are therefore the natural unit of isolation when it comes to validating your application's behavior. From a granularity perspective, component testing sits somewhere above unit testing and can be considered a form of integration testing. Much of your Vue Application should be covered by a component test and we recommend that each Vue component has its own spec file.</p>\n<p>Component tests should catch issues relating to your component's props, events, slots that it provides, styles, classes, lifecycle hooks, and more.</p>\n<p>Component tests should not mock child components, but instead test the interactions between your component and its children by interacting with the components as a user would. For example, a component test should click on an element like a user would instead of programmatically interacting with the component.</p>\n<p>Component tests should focus on the component's public interfaces rather than internal implementation details.

In short, browser-based runners, like Cypress, can catch issues that node-based runners, like Vitest, cannot (e.g. style issues, real native DOM events, cookies, local storage, and network failures), but browser-based runners are <em>orders of magnitude slower than Vitest</em> because they do open a browser, compile your stylesheets, and more.

As a result, end-to-end (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications.</p>\n<p>End-to-end tests focus on multi-page application behavior that makes network requests against your production-built Vue application. They often involve standing up a database or other backend and may even be run against a live staging environment.</p>\n<p>End-to-end tests will often catch issues with your router, state management library, top-level components (e.g. an App or Layout), public assets, or any request handling. As stated above, they catch critical issues that may be impossible to catch with unit tests or component tests.</p>\n<p>End-to-end tests do not import any of your Vue application's code but instead rely completely on testing your application by navigating through entire pages in a real browser.</p>\n<p>End-to-end tests validate many of the layers in your application. They can either target your locally built application or even a live Staging environment. Testing against your Staging environment not only includes your frontend code and static server but all associated backend services and infrastructure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The more your tests resemble how your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kent C. Dodds</a> - Author of the Testing Library</p></blockquote>\n<p>By testing how user actions impact your application, E2E tests are often the key to higher confidence in whether an application is functioning properly or not.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosing-an-e2e-testing-solution\" tabindex=\"-1\">Choosing an E2E Testing Solution </h3>\n<p>While end-to-end (E2E) testing on the web has gained a negative reputation for unreliable (flaky) tests and slowing down development processes, modern E2E tools have made strides forward to create more reliable, interactive, and useful tests. When choosing an E2E testing framework, the following sections provide some guidance on things to keep in mind when choosing a testing framework for your application.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cross-browser-testing\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cross-browser testing </h4>\n<p>One of the primary benefits that end-to-end (E2E) testing is known for is its ability to test your application across multiple browsers. While it may seem desirable to have 100% cross-browser coverage, it is important to note that cross browser testing has diminishing returns on a team's resources due to the additional time and machine power required to run them consistently. As a result, it is important to be mindful of this trade-off when choosing the amount of cross-browser testing your application needs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"faster-feedback-loops\" tabindex=\"-1\">Faster feedback loops </h4>\n<p>One of the primary problems with end-to-end (E2E) tests and development is that running the entire suite takes a long time. Typically, this is only done in continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Modern E2E testing frameworks have helped to solve this by adding features like parallelization, which allows for CI/CD pipelines to often run magnitudes faster than before. In addition, when developing locally, the ability to selectively run a single test for the page you are working on while also providing hot reloading of tests can help boost a developer's workflow and productivity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"first-class-debugging-experience\" tabindex=\"-1\">First-class debugging experience </h4>\n<p>While developers have traditionally relied on scanning logs in a terminal window to help determine what went wrong in a test, modern end-to-end (E2E) test frameworks allow developers to leverage tools they are already familiar with, e.g. browser developer tools.</p>\n<h4 id=\"visibility-in-headless-mode\" tabindex=\"-1\">Visibility in headless mode </h4>\n<p>When end-to-end (E2E) tests are run in continuous integration/deployment pipelines, they are often run in headless browsers (i.e., no visible browser is opened for the user to watch). A critical feature of modern E2E testing frameworks is the ability to see snapshots and/or videos of the application during testing, providing some insight into why errors are happening. Historically, it was tedious to maintain these integrations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommendation-2\" tabindex=\"-1\">Recommendation </h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Playwright</a> is a great E2E testing solution that supports Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox.

However, there are always challenging scenarios where extra fine-tuning is needed. In this section, we will discuss what you should pay attention to when it comes to performance in a Vue application.</p>\n<p>First, let's discuss the two major aspects of web performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Page Load Performance</strong>: how fast the application shows content and becomes interactive on the initial visit. This is usually measured using web vital metrics like <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a> and <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/inp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Interaction to Next Paint</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Update Performance</strong>: how fast the application updates in response to user input. For example, how fast a list updates when the user types in a search box, or how fast the page switches when the user clicks a navigation link in a Single-Page Application (SPA).</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it would be ideal to maximize both, different frontend architectures tend to affect how easy it is to attain desired performance in these aspects. In addition, the type of application you are building greatly influences what you should prioritize in terms of performance. Therefore, the first step of ensuring optimal performance is picking the right architecture for the type of application you are building:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Consult <a href=\"../extras/ways-of-using-vue\">Ways of Using Vue</a> to see how you can leverage Vue in different ways.</p></li>\n<li><p>Jason Miller discusses the types of web applications and their respective ideal implementation / delivery in <a href=\"https://jasonformat.com/application-holotypes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Application Holotypes</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"profiling-options\" tabindex=\"-1\">Profiling Options </h2>\n<p>To improve performance, we need to first know how to measure it. There are a number of great tools that can help in this regard:</p>\n<p>For profiling load performance of production deployments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PageSpeed Insights</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webpagetest.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WebPageTest</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For profiling performance during local development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chrome DevTools Performance Panel</a><ul><li>\n<a href=\"../../api/application#app-config-performance\"><code>app.config.performance</code></a> enables Vue-specific performance markers in Chrome DevTools' performance timeline.</li></ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"../scaling-up/tooling#browser-devtools\">Vue DevTools Extension</a> also provides a performance profiling feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"page-load-optimizations\" tabindex=\"-1\">Page Load Optimizations </h2>\n<p>There are many framework-agnostic aspects for optimizing page load performance - check out <a href=\"https://web.dev/fast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this web.dev guide</a> for a comprehensive round up. Here, we will primarily focus on techniques that are specific to Vue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosing-the-right-architecture\" tabindex=\"-1\">Choosing the Right Architecture </h3>\n<p>If your use case is sensitive to page load performance, avoid shipping it as a pure client-side SPA. You want your server to be directly sending HTML containing the content the users want to see. Pure client-side rendering suffers from slow time-to-content. This can be mitigated with <a href=\"../extras/ways-of-using-vue#fullstack-ssr\">Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</a> or <a href=\"../extras/ways-of-using-vue#jamstack-ssg\">Static Site Generation (SSG)</a>. Check out the <a href=\"../scaling-up/ssr\">SSR Guide</a> to learn about performing SSR with Vue. If your app doesn't have rich interactivity requirements, you can also use a traditional backend server to render the HTML and enhance it with Vue on the client.</p>\n<p>If your main application has to be an SPA, but has marketing pages (landing, about, blog), ship them separately! Your marketing pages should ideally be deployed as static HTML with minimal JS, by using SSG.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bundle-size-and-tree-shaking\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bundle Size and Tree-shaking </h3>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to improve page load performance is shipping smaller JavaScript bundles. Here are a few ways to reduce bundle size when using Vue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use a build step if possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Many of Vue's APIs are <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"tree-shakable\"</a> if bundled via a modern build tool. For example, if you don't use the built-in <code>&lt;Transition&gt;</code> component, it won't be included in the final production bundle. Tree-shaking can also remove other unused modules in your source code.</p></li>\n<li><p>When using a build step, templates are pre-compiled so we don't need to ship the Vue compiler to the browser. This saves <strong>14kb</strong> min+gzipped JavaScript and avoids the runtime compilation cost.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be cautious of size when introducing new dependencies! In real-world applications, bloated bundles are most often a result of introducing heavy dependencies without realizing it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If using a build step, prefer dependencies that offer ES module formats and are tree-shaking friendly. For example, prefer <code>lodash-es</code> over <code>lodash</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Check a dependency's size and evaluate whether it is worth the functionality it provides. Note if the dependency is tree-shaking friendly, the actual size increase will depend on the APIs you actually import from it. Tools like <a href=\"https://bundlejs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bundlejs.com</a> can be used for quick checks, but measuring with your actual build setup will always be the most accurate.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you are using Vue primarily for progressive enhancement and prefer to avoid a build step, consider using <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">petite-vue</a> (only <strong>6kb</strong>) instead.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"code-splitting\" tabindex=\"-1\">Code Splitting </h3>\n<p>Code splitting is where a build tool splits the application bundle into multiple smaller chunks, which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. With proper code splitting, features required at page load can be downloaded immediately, with additional chunks being lazy loaded only when needed, thus improving performance.</p>\n<p>Bundlers like Rollup (which Vite is based upon) or webpack can automatically create split chunks by detecting the ESM dynamic import syntax:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// lazy.js and its dependencies will be split into a separate chunk\n// and only loaded when `loadLazy()` is called.\nfunction loadLazy() {\n  return import('./lazy.js')\n}</pre>\n<p>Lazy loading is best used on features that are not immediately needed after initial page load. In Vue applications, this can be used in combination with Vue's <a href=\"../components/async\">Async Component</a> feature to create split chunks for component trees:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\n// a separate chunk is created for Foo.vue and its dependencies.\n// it is only fetched on demand when the async component is\n// rendered on the page.\nconst Foo = defineAsyncComponent(() =&gt; import('./Foo.vue'))</pre>\n<p>For applications using Vue Router, it is strongly recommended to use lazy loading for route components. Vue Router has explicit support for lazy loading, separate from <code>defineAsyncComponent</code>. See <a href=\"https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lazy Loading Routes</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"update-optimizations\" tabindex=\"-1\">Update Optimizations </h2>\n<h3 id=\"props-stability\" tabindex=\"-1\">Props Stability </h3>\n<p>In Vue, a child component only updates when at least one of its received props has changed. Consider the following example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;ListItem\n  v-for=\"item in list\"\n  :id=\"item.id\"\n  :active-id=\"activeId\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>Inside the <code>&lt;ListItem&gt;</code> component, it uses its <code>id</code> and <code>activeId</code> props to determine whether it is the currently active item. While this works, the problem is that whenever <code>activeId</code> changes, <strong>every</strong> <code>&lt;ListItem&gt;</code> in the list has to update!</p>\n<p>Ideally, only the items whose active status changed should update. We can achieve that by moving the active status computation into the parent, and make <code>&lt;ListItem&gt;</code> directly accept an <code>active</code> prop instead:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;ListItem\n  v-for=\"item in list\"\n  :id=\"item.id\"\n  :active=\"item.id === activeId\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>Now, for most components the <code>active</code> prop will remain the same when <code>activeId</code> changes, so they no longer need to update. In general, the idea is keeping the props passed to child components as stable as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"v-once\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<code>v-once</code> </h3>\n<p><code>v-once</code> is a built-in directive that can be used to render content that relies on runtime data but never needs to update. The entire sub-tree it is used on will be skipped for all future updates. Consult its <a href=\"../../api/built-in-directives#v-once\">API reference</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"v-memo\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n<code>v-memo</code> </h3>\n<p><code>v-memo</code> is a built-in directive that can be used to conditionally skip the update of large sub-trees or <code>v-for</code> lists. Consult its <a href=\"../../api/built-in-directives#v-memo\">API reference</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"computed-stability\" tabindex=\"-1\">Computed Stability </h3>\n<p>In Vue 3.4 and above, a computed property will only trigger effects when its computed value has changed from the previous one. For example, the following <code>isEven</code> computed only triggers effects if the returned value has changed from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>, or vice-versa:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const count = ref(0)\nconst isEven = computed(() =&gt; count.value % 2 === 0)\n\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; console.log(isEven.value)) // true\n\n// will not trigger new logs because the computed value stays `true`\ncount.value = 2\ncount.value = 4</pre>\n<p>This reduces unnecessary effect triggers, but unfortunately doesn't work if the computed creates a new object on each compute:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const computedObj = computed(() =&gt; {\n  return {\n    isEven: count.value % 2 === 0\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>Because a new object is created each time, the new value is technically always different from the old value. Even if the <code>isEven</code> property remains the same, Vue won't be able to know unless it performs a deep comparison of the old value and the new value. Such comparison could be expensive and likely not worth it.</p>\n<p>Instead, we can optimize this by manually comparing the new value with the old value, and conditionally returning the old value if we know nothing has changed:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const computedObj = computed((oldValue) =&gt; {\n  const newValue = {\n    isEven: count.value % 2 === 0\n  }\n  if (oldValue &amp;&amp; oldValue.isEven === newValue.isEven) {\n    return oldValue\n  }\n  return newValue\n})</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the playground</a></p>\n<p>Note that you should always perform the full computation before comparing and returning the old value, so that the same dependencies can be collected on every run.</p>\n<h2 id=\"general-optimizations\" tabindex=\"-1\">General Optimizations </h2>\n<blockquote><p>The following tips affect both page load and update performance.</p></blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"virtualize-large-lists\" tabindex=\"-1\">Virtualize Large Lists </h3>\n<p>One of the most common performance issues in all frontend applications is rendering large lists. No matter how performant a framework is, rendering a list with thousands of items <strong>will</strong> be slow due to the sheer number of DOM nodes that the browser needs to handle.</p>\n<p>However, we don't necessarily have to render all these nodes upfront. In most cases, the user's screen size can display only a small subset of our large list. We can greatly improve the performance with <strong>list virtualization</strong>, the technique of only rendering the items that are currently in or close to the viewport in a large list.</p>\n<p>Implementing list virtualization isn't easy, luckily there are existing community libraries that you can directly use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">vue-virtual-scroller</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rocwang/vue-virtual-scroll-grid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">vue-virtual-scroll-grid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/07akioni/vueuc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">vueuc/VVirtualList</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"reduce-reactivity-overhead-for-large-immutable-structures\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reduce Reactivity Overhead for Large Immutable Structures </h3>\n<p>Vue's reactivity system is deep by default. While this makes state management intuitive, it does create a certain level of overhead when the data size is large, because every property access triggers proxy traps that perform dependency tracking. This typically becomes noticeable when dealing with large arrays of deeply nested objects, where a single render needs to access 100,000+ properties, so it should only affect very specific use cases.</p>\n<p>Vue does provide an escape hatch to opt-out of deep reactivity by using <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref\"><code>shallowRef()</code></a> and <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive\"><code>shallowReactive()</code></a>. Shallow APIs create state that is reactive only at the root level, and exposes all nested objects untouched. This keeps nested property access fast, with the trade-off being that we must now treat all nested objects as immutable, and updates can only be triggered by replacing the root state:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const shallowArray = shallowRef([\n  /* big list of deep objects */\n])\n\n// this won't trigger updates...\nshallowArray.value.push(newObject)\n// this does:\nshallowArray.value = [...shallowArray.value, newObject]\n\n// this won't trigger updates...\nshallowArray.value[0].foo = 1\n// this does:\nshallowArray.value = [\n  {\n    ...shallowArray.value[0],\n    foo: 1\n  },\n  ...shallowArray.value.slice(1)\n]</pre>\n<h3 id=\"avoid-unnecessary-component-abstractions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Avoid Unnecessary Component Abstractions </h3>\n<p>Sometimes we may create <a href=\"../components/slots#renderless-components\">renderless components</a> or higher-order components (i.e. components that render other components with extra props) for better abstraction or code organization. While there is nothing wrong with this, do keep in mind that component instances are much more expensive than plain DOM nodes, and creating too many of them due to abstraction patterns will incur performance costs.</p>\n<p>Note that reducing only a few instances won't have noticeable effect, so don't sweat it if the component is rendered only a few times in the app. The best scenario to consider this optimization is again in large lists. Imagine a list of 100 items where each item component contains many child components. Removing one unnecessary component abstraction here could result in a reduction of hundreds of component instances.</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/performance\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/performance</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/best-practices/security":"<h1 id=\"security\" tabindex=\"-1\">Security </h1>\n<h2 id=\"reporting-vulnerabilities\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reporting Vulnerabilities </h2>\n<p>When a vulnerability is reported, it immediately becomes our top concern, with a full-time contributor dropping everything to work on it. To report a vulnerability, please email <a href=\"mailto:security@vuejs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">security@vuejs.org</a>.</p>\n<p>While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of Vue and its official companion libraries to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rule-no-1-never-use-non-trusted-templates\" tabindex=\"-1\">Rule No.1: Never Use Non-trusted Templates </h2>\n<p>The most fundamental security rule when using Vue is <strong>never use non-trusted content as your component template</strong>. Doing so is equivalent to allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in your application - and worse, could lead to server breaches if the code is executed during server-side rendering. An example of such usage:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">Vue.createApp({\n  template: `&lt;div&gt;` + userProvidedString + `&lt;/div&gt;` // NEVER DO THIS\n}).mount('#app')</pre>\n<p>Vue templates are compiled into JavaScript, and expressions inside templates will be executed as part of the rendering process. Although the expressions are evaluated against a specific rendering context, due to the complexity of potential global execution environments, it is impractical for a framework like Vue to completely shield you from potential malicious code execution without incurring unrealistic performance overhead. The most straightforward way to avoid this category of problems altogether is to make sure the contents of your Vue templates are always trusted and entirely controlled by you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-vue-does-to-protect-you\" tabindex=\"-1\">What Vue Does to Protect You </h2>\n<h3 id=\"html-content\" tabindex=\"-1\">HTML content </h3>\n<p>Whether using templates or render functions, content is automatically escaped. That means in this template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;h1&gt;{{ userProvidedString }}&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>\n<p>if <code>userProvidedString</code> contained:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">'&lt;script&gt;alert(\"hi\")&lt;/script&gt;'</pre>\n<p>then it would be escaped to the following HTML:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(&amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;</pre>\n<p>thus preventing the script injection. This escaping is done using native browser APIs, like <code>textContent</code>, so a vulnerability can only exist if the browser itself is vulnerable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attribute-bindings\" tabindex=\"-1\">Attribute bindings </h3>\n<p>Similarly, dynamic attribute bindings are also automatically escaped. That means in this template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;h1 :title=\"userProvidedString\"&gt;\n  hello\n&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>\n<p>if <code>userProvidedString</code> contained:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">'\" onclick=\"alert(\\'hi\\')'</pre>\n<p>then it would be escaped to the following HTML:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&amp;quot; onclick=&amp;quot;alert('hi')</pre>\n<p>thus preventing the close of the <code>title</code> attribute to inject new, arbitrary HTML. This escaping is done using native browser APIs, like <code>setAttribute</code>, so a vulnerability can only exist if the browser itself is vulnerable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"potential-dangers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Potential Dangers </h2>\n<p>In any web application, allowing unsanitized, user-provided content to be executed as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is potentially dangerous, so it should be avoided wherever possible. There are times when some risk may be acceptable, though.</p>\n<p>For example, services like CodePen and JSFiddle allow user-provided content to be executed, but it's in a context where this is expected and sandboxed to some extent inside iframes. In the cases when an important feature inherently requires some level of vulnerability, it's up to your team to weigh the importance of the feature against the worst-case scenarios the vulnerability enables.</p>\n<h3 id=\"html-injection\" tabindex=\"-1\">HTML Injection </h3>\n<p>As you learned earlier, Vue automatically escapes HTML content, preventing you from accidentally injecting executable HTML into your application. However, <strong>in cases where you know the HTML is safe</strong>, you can explicitly render HTML content:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Using a template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div v-html=\"userProvidedHtml\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using a render function:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">h('div', {\n  innerHTML: this.userProvidedHtml\n})</pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using a render function with JSX:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"jsx\">&lt;div innerHTML={this.userProvidedHtml}&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">WARNING</strong><p>User-provided HTML can never be considered 100% safe unless it's in a sandboxed iframe or in a part of the app where only the user who wrote that HTML can ever be exposed to it. Additionally, allowing users to write their own Vue templates brings similar dangers.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"url-injection\" tabindex=\"-1\">URL Injection </h3>\n<p>In a URL like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;a :href=\"userProvidedUrl\"&gt;\n  click me\n&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>There's a potential security issue if the URL has not been \"sanitized\" to prevent JavaScript execution using <code>javascript:</code>. There are libraries such as <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@braintree/sanitize-url\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sanitize-url</a> to help with this, but note: if you're ever doing URL sanitization on the frontend, you already have a security issue. <strong>User-provided URLs should always be sanitized by your backend before even being saved to a database.</strong> Then the problem is avoided for <em>every</em> client connecting to your API, including native mobile apps. Also note that even with sanitized URLs, Vue cannot help you guarantee that they lead to safe destinations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"style-injection\" tabindex=\"-1\">Style Injection </h3>\n<p>Looking at this example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;a\n  :href=\"sanitizedUrl\"\n  :style=\"userProvidedStyles\"\n&gt;\n  click me\n&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>Let's assume that <code>sanitizedUrl</code> has been sanitized, so that it's definitely a real URL and not JavaScript. With the <code>userProvidedStyles</code>, malicious users could still provide CSS to \"click jack\", e.g. styling the link into a transparent box over the \"Log in\" button. Then if <code>https://user-controlled-website.com/</code> is built to resemble the login page of your application, they might have just captured a user's real login information.</p>\n<p>You may be able to imagine how allowing user-provided content for a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element would create an even greater vulnerability, giving that user full control over how to style the entire page. That's why Vue prevents rendering of style tags inside templates, such as:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;style&gt;{{ userProvidedStyles }}&lt;/style&gt;</pre>\n<p>To keep your users fully safe from clickjacking, we recommend only allowing full control over CSS inside a sandboxed iframe. Alternatively, when providing user control through a style binding, we recommend using its <a href=\"../essentials/class-and-style#binding-to-objects-1\">object syntax</a> and only allowing users to provide values for specific properties it's safe for them to control, like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;a\n  :href=\"sanitizedUrl\"\n  :style=\"{\n    color: userProvidedColor,\n    background: userProvidedBackground\n  }\"\n&gt;\n  click me\n&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"javascript-injection\" tabindex=\"-1\">JavaScript Injection </h3>\n<p>We strongly discourage ever rendering a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element with Vue, since templates and render functions should never have side effects. However, this isn't the only way to include strings that would be evaluated as JavaScript at runtime.</p>\n<p>Every HTML element has attributes with values accepting strings of JavaScript, such as <code>onclick</code>, <code>onfocus</code>, and <code>onmouseenter</code>. Binding user-provided JavaScript to any of these event attributes is a potential security risk, so it should be avoided.</p>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">WARNING</strong><p>User-provided JavaScript can never be considered 100% safe unless it's in a sandboxed iframe or in a part of the app where only the user who wrote that JavaScript can ever be exposed to it.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Sometimes we receive vulnerability reports on how it's possible to do cross-site scripting (XSS) in Vue templates. In general, we do not consider such cases to be actual vulnerabilities because there's no practical way to protect developers from the two scenarios that would allow XSS:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The developer is explicitly asking Vue to render user-provided, unsanitized content as Vue templates. This is inherently unsafe, and there's no way for Vue to know the origin.</p></li>\n<li><p>The developer is mounting Vue to an entire HTML page which happens to contain server-rendered and user-provided content. This is fundamentally the same problem as #1, but sometimes devs may do it without realizing it. This can lead to possible vulnerabilities where the attacker provides HTML which is safe as plain HTML but unsafe as a Vue template. The best practice is to <strong>never mount Vue on nodes that may contain server-rendered and user-provided content</strong>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"best-practices\" tabindex=\"-1\">Best Practices </h2>\n<p>The general rule is that if you allow unsanitized, user-provided content to be executed (as either HTML, JavaScript, or even CSS), you might open yourself up to attacks. This advice actually holds true whether using Vue, another framework, or even no framework.</p>\n<p>Beyond the recommendations made above for <a href=\"#potential-dangers\">Potential Dangers</a>, we also recommend familiarizing yourself with these resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://html5sec.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HTML5 Security Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OWASP's Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then use what you learn to also review the source code of your dependencies for potentially dangerous patterns, if any of them include 3rd-party components or otherwise influence what's rendered to the DOM.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backend-coordination\" tabindex=\"-1\">Backend Coordination </h2>\n<p>HTTP security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) and cross-site script inclusion (XSSI), are primarily addressed on the backend, so they aren't a concern of Vue's. However, it's still a good idea to communicate with your backend team to learn how to best interact with their API, e.g., by submitting CSRF tokens with form submissions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"server-side-rendering-ssr\" tabindex=\"-1\">Server-Side Rendering (SSR) </h2>\n<p>There are some additional security concerns when using SSR, so make sure to follow the best practices outlined throughout <a href=\"../scaling-up/ssr\">our SSR documentation</a> to avoid vulnerabilities.</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/security\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/security</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/typescript/overview":"<h1 id=\"using-vue-with-typescript\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using Vue with TypeScript </h1>\n<p>A type system like TypeScript can detect many common errors via static analysis at build time.

The base config is abstracted in the <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/tsconfig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>@vue/tsconfig</code></a> package. Inside the project, we use <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Project References</a> to ensure correct types for code running in different environments (e.g. app code and test code should have different global variables).</p>\n<p>When configuring <code>tsconfig.json</code> manually, some notable options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#isolatedModules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>compilerOptions.isolatedModules</code></a> is set to <code>true</code> because Vite uses <a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">esbuild</a> for transpiling TypeScript and is subject to single-file transpile limitations. <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#verbatimModuleSyntax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>compilerOptions.verbatimModuleSyntax</code></a> is <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/53601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a superset of <code>isolatedModules</code></a> and is a good choice, too - it's what <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/tsconfig\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>@vue/tsconfig</code></a> uses.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you're using Options API, you need to set <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>compilerOptions.strict</code></a> to <code>true</code> (or at least enable <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitThis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>compilerOptions.noImplicitThis</code></a>, which is a part of the <code>strict</code> flag) to leverage type checking of <code>this</code> in component options. Otherwise <code>this</code> will be treated as <code>any</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you have configured resolver aliases in your build tool, for example the <code>@/*</code> alias configured by default in a <code>create-vue</code> project, you need to also configure it for TypeScript via <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>compilerOptions.paths</code></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you intend to use TSX with Vue, set <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>compilerOptions.jsx</code></a> to <code>\"preserve\"</code>, and set <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsxImportSource\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>compilerOptions.jsxImportSource</code></a> to <code>\"vue\"</code>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Official TypeScript compiler options docs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#typescript-caveats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">esbuild TypeScript compilation caveats</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"note-on-vue-cli-and-ts-loader\" tabindex=\"-1\">Note on Vue CLI and <code>ts-loader</code> </h3>\n<p>In webpack-based setups such as Vue CLI, it is common to perform type checking as part of the module transform pipeline, for example with <code>ts-loader</code>. This, however, isn't a clean solution because the type system needs knowledge of the entire module graph to perform type checks. Individual module's transform step simply is not the right place for the task. It leads to the following problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>ts-loader</code> can only type check post-transform code. This doesn't align with the errors we see in IDEs or from <code>vue-tsc</code>, which map directly back to the source code.</p></li>\n<li><p>Type checking can be slow. When it is performed in the same thread / process with code transformations, it significantly affects the build speed of the entire application.</p></li>\n<li><p>We already have type checking running right in our IDE in a separate process, so the cost of dev experience slow down simply isn't a good trade-off.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are currently using Vue 3 + TypeScript via Vue CLI, we strongly recommend migrating over to Vite.

By default, Vue components produce and manipulate DOM in the browser as output. However, it is also possible to render the same components into HTML strings on the server, send them directly to the browser, and finally \"hydrate\" the static markup into a fully interactive app on the client.</p>\n<p>A server-rendered Vue.js app can also be considered \"isomorphic\" or \"universal\", in the sense that the majority of your app's code runs on both the server <strong>and</strong> the client.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-ssr\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why SSR? </h3>\n<p>Compared to a client-side Single-Page Application (SPA), the advantage of SSR primarily lies in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Faster time-to-content</strong>: this is more prominent on slow internet or slow devices. Server-rendered markup doesn't need to wait until all JavaScript has been downloaded and executed to be displayed, so your user will see a fully-rendered page sooner. In addition, data fetching is done on the server-side for the initial visit, which likely has a faster connection to your database than the client. This generally results in improved <a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Core Web Vitals</a> metrics, better user experience, and can be critical for applications where time-to-content is directly associated with conversion rate.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Unified mental model</strong>: you get to use the same language and the same declarative, component-oriented mental model for developing your entire app, instead of jumping back and forth between a backend templating system and a frontend framework.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Better SEO</strong>: the search engine crawlers will directly see the fully rendered page.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>As of now, Google and Bing can index synchronous JavaScript applications just fine. Synchronous being the key word there. If your app starts with a loading spinner, then fetches content via Ajax, the crawler will not wait for you to finish. This means if you have content fetched asynchronously on pages where SEO is important, SSR might be necessary.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also some trade-offs to consider when using SSR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Development constraints. Browser-specific code can only be used inside certain lifecycle hooks; some external libraries may need special treatment to be able to run in a server-rendered app.</p></li>\n<li><p>More involved build setup and deployment requirements. Unlike a fully static SPA that can be deployed on any static file server, a server-rendered app requires an environment where a Node.js server can run.</p></li>\n<li><p>More server-side load. Rendering a full app in Node.js is going to be more CPU-intensive than just serving static files, so if you expect high traffic, be prepared for corresponding server load and wisely employ caching strategies.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before using SSR for your app, the first question you should ask is whether you actually need it. It mostly depends on how important time-to-content is for your app. For example, if you are building an internal dashboard where an extra few hundred milliseconds on initial load doesn't matter that much, SSR would be an overkill. However, in cases where time-to-content is absolutely critical, SSR can help you achieve the best possible initial load performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ssr-vs-ssg\" tabindex=\"-1\">SSR vs. SSG </h3>\n<p><strong>Static Site Generation (SSG)</strong>, also referred to as pre-rendering, is another popular technique for building fast websites. If the data needed to server-render a page is the same for every user, then instead of rendering the page every time a request comes in, we can render it only once, ahead of time, during the build process. Pre-rendered pages are generated and served as static HTML files.</p>\n<p>SSG retains the same performance characteristics of SSR apps: it provides great time-to-content performance. At the same time, it is cheaper and easier to deploy than SSR apps because the output is static HTML and assets. The keyword here is <strong>static</strong>: SSG can only be applied to pages providing static data, i.e. data that is known at build time and can not change between requests. Every time the data changes, a new deployment is needed.</p>\n<p>If you're only investigating SSR to improve the SEO of a handful of marketing pages (e.g. <code>/</code>, <code>/about</code>, <code>/contact</code>, etc.), then you probably want SSG instead of SSR. SSG is also great for content-based websites such as documentation sites or blogs.

The HTML is completely static on the client since we are not loading Vue in the browser.</p>\n<p>To make the client-side app interactive, Vue needs to perform the <strong>hydration</strong> step. During hydration, it creates the same Vue application that was run on the server, matches each component to the DOM nodes it should control, and attaches DOM event listeners.</p>\n<p>To mount an app in hydration mode, we need to use <a href=\"../../api/application#createssrapp\"><code>createSSRApp()</code></a> instead of <code>createApp()</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// this runs in the browser.\nimport { createSSRApp } from 'vue'\n\nconst app = createSSRApp({\n  // ...same app as on server\n})\n\n// mounting an SSR app on the client assumes\n// the HTML was pre-rendered and will perform\n// hydration instead of mounting new DOM nodes.\napp.mount('#app')</pre>\n<h3 id=\"code-structure\" tabindex=\"-1\">Code Structure </h3>\n<p>Notice how we need to reuse the same app implementation as on the server. This is where we need to start thinking about code structure in an SSR app - how do we share the same application code between the server and the client?</p>\n<p>Here we will demonstrate the most bare-bones setup. First, let's split the app creation logic into a dedicated file, <code>app.js</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"app.js\">app.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// (shared between server and client)\nimport { createSSRApp } from 'vue'\n\nexport function createApp() {\n  return createSSRApp({\n    data: () =&gt; ({ count: 1 }),\n    template: `&lt;button @click=\"count++\"&gt;{{ count }}&lt;/button&gt;`\n  })\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>This file and its dependencies are shared between the server and the client - we call them <strong>universal code</strong>. There are a number of things you need to pay attention to when writing universal code, as we will <a href=\"#writing-ssr-friendly-code\">discuss below</a>.</p>\n<p>Our client entry imports the universal code, creates the app, and performs the mount:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"client.js\">client.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { createApp } from './app.js'\n\ncreateApp().mount('#app')</pre>\n</div>\n<p>And the server uses the same app creation logic in the request handler:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"server.js\">server.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// (irrelevant code omitted)\nimport { createApp } from './app.js'\n\nserver.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const app = createApp()\n  renderToString(app).then(html =&gt; {\n    // ...\n  })\n})</pre>\n</div>\n<p>In addition, in order to load the client files in the browser, we also need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Serve client files by adding <code>server.use(express.static('.'))</code> in <code>server.js</code>.</li>\n<li>Load the client entry by adding <code>&lt;script type=\"module\" src=\"/client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to the HTML shell.</li>\n<li>Support usage like <code>import * from 'vue'</code> in the browser by adding an <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/import-maps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Import Map</a> to the HTML shell.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/fork/vue-ssr-example?file=index.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try the completed example on StackBlitz</a>. The button is now interactive!</p>\n<h2 id=\"higher-level-solutions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Higher Level Solutions </h2>\n<p>Moving from the example to a production-ready SSR app involves a lot more. We will need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Support Vue SFCs and other build step requirements. In fact, we will need to coordinate two builds for the same app: one for the client, and one for the server.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Vue components are compiled differently when used for SSR - templates are compiled into string concatenations instead of Virtual DOM render functions for more efficient rendering performance.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the server request handler, render the HTML with the correct client-side asset links and optimal resource hints. We may also need to switch between SSR and SSG mode, or even mix both in the same app.</p></li>\n<li><p>Manage routing, data fetching, and state management stores in a universal manner.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A complete implementation would be quite complex and depends on the build toolchain you have chosen to work with. Therefore, we highly recommend going with a higher-level, opinionated solution that abstracts away the complexity for you. Below we will introduce a few recommended SSR solutions in the Vue ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nuxt\" tabindex=\"-1\">Nuxt </h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://nuxt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nuxt</a> is a higher-level framework built on top of the Vue ecosystem which provides a streamlined development experience for writing universal Vue applications. Better yet, you can also use it as a static site generator!

It not only handles the build setup, but also provides a full collection of Material Design compliant UI components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vite-ssr\" tabindex=\"-1\">Vite SSR </h3>\n<p>Vite provides built-in <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">support for Vue server-side rendering</a>, but it is intentionally low-level. If you wish to go directly with Vite, check out <a href=\"https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">vite-plugin-ssr</a>, a community plugin that abstracts away many challenging details for you.</p>\n<p>You can also find an example Vue + Vite SSR project using manual setup <a href=\"https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/playground/ssr-vue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, which can serve as a base to build upon. Note this is only recommended if you are experienced with SSR / build tools and really want to have complete control over the higher-level architecture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-ssr-friendly-code\" tabindex=\"-1\">Writing SSR-friendly Code </h2>\n<p>Regardless of your build setup or higher-level framework choice, there are some principles that apply in all Vue SSR applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reactivity-on-the-server\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reactivity on the Server </h3>\n<p>During SSR, each request URL maps to a desired state of our application. There is no user interaction and no DOM updates, so reactivity is unnecessary on the server. By default, reactivity is disabled during SSR for better performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"component-lifecycle-hooks\" tabindex=\"-1\">Component Lifecycle Hooks </h3>\n<p>Since there are no dynamic updates, lifecycle hooks such as <span class=\"options-api\"><code>mounted</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onMounted</code></span> or <span class=\"options-api\"><code>updated</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onUpdated</code></span> will <strong>NOT</strong> be called during SSR and will only be executed on the client.<span class=\"options-api\"> The only hooks that are called during SSR are <code>beforeCreate</code> and <code>created</code></span></p>\n<p>You should avoid code that produces side effects that need cleanup in <span class=\"options-api\"><code>beforeCreate</code> and <code>created</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>setup()</code> or the root scope of <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code></span>. An example of such side effects is setting up timers with <code>setInterval</code>. In client-side only code we may setup a timer and then tear it down in <span class=\"options-api\"><code>beforeUnmount</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onBeforeUnmount</code></span> or <span class=\"options-api\"><code>unmounted</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onUnmounted</code></span>. However, because the unmount hooks will never be called during SSR, the timers will stay around forever. To avoid this, move your side-effect code into <span class=\"options-api\"><code>mounted</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onMounted</code></span> instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"access-to-platform-specific-apis\" tabindex=\"-1\">Access to Platform-Specific APIs </h3>\n<p>Universal code cannot assume access to platform-specific APIs, so if your code directly uses browser-only globals like <code>window</code> or <code>document</code>, they will throw errors when executed in Node.js, and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>For tasks that are shared between server and client but with different platform APIs, it's recommended to wrap the platform-specific implementations inside a universal API, or use libraries that do this for you. For example, you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>node-fetch</code></a> to use the same fetch API on both server and client.</p>\n<p>For browser-only APIs, the common approach is to lazily access them inside client-only lifecycle hooks such as <span class=\"options-api\"><code>mounted</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onMounted</code></span>.</p>\n<p>Note that if a third-party library is not written with universal usage in mind, it could be tricky to integrate it into a server-rendered app. You <em>might</em> be able to get it working by mocking some of the globals, but it would be hacky and may interfere with the environment detection code of other libraries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cross-request-state-pollution\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cross-Request State Pollution </h3>\n<p>In the State Management chapter, we introduced a <a href=\"state-management#simple-state-management-with-reactivity-api\">simple state management pattern using Reactivity APIs</a>. In an SSR context, this pattern requires some additional adjustments.</p>\n<p>The pattern declares shared state in a JavaScript module's root scope. This makes them <strong>singletons</strong> - i.e. there is only one instance of the reactive object throughout the entire lifecycle of our application. This works as expected in a pure client-side Vue application, since the modules in our application are initialized fresh for each browser page visit.</p>\n<p>However, in an SSR context, the application modules are typically initialized only once on the server, when the server boots up. The same module instances will be reused across multiple server requests, and so will our singleton state objects. If we mutate the shared singleton state with data specific to one user, it can be accidentally leaked to a request from another user. We call this <strong>cross-request state pollution.</strong></p>\n<p>We can technically re-initialize all the JavaScript modules on each request, just like we do in browsers. However, initializing JavaScript modules can be costly, so this would significantly affect server performance.</p>\n<p>The recommended solution is to create a new instance of the entire application - including the router and global stores - on each request. Then, instead of directly importing it in our components, we provide the shared state using <a href=\"../components/provide-inject#app-level-provide\">app-level provide</a> and inject it in components that need it:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"app.js\">app.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// (shared between server and client)\nimport { createSSRApp } from 'vue'\nimport { createStore } from './store.js'\n\n// called on each request\nexport function createApp() {\n  const app = createSSRApp(/* ... */)\n  // create new instance of store per request\n  const store = createStore(/* ... */)\n  // provide store at the app level\n  app.provide('store', store)\n  // also expose store for hydration purposes\n  return { app, store }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>State Management libraries like Pinia are designed with this in mind. Consult <a href=\"https://pinia.vuejs.org/ssr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pinia's SSR guide</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hydration-mismatch\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hydration Mismatch </h3>\n<p>If the DOM structure of the pre-rendered HTML does not match the expected output of the client-side app, there will be a hydration mismatch error. Hydration mismatch is most commonly introduced by the following causes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The template contains invalid HTML nesting structure, and the rendered HTML got \"corrected\" by the browser's native HTML parsing behavior. For example, a common gotcha is that <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8397852/why-cant-the-p-tag-contain-a-div-tag-inside-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> cannot be placed inside <code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;hi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>If we produce this in our server-rendered HTML, the browser will terminate the first <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> when <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is encountered and parse it into the following DOM structure:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;hi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data used during render contains randomly generated values. Since the same application will run twice - once on the server, and once on the client - the random values are not guaranteed to be the same between the two runs. There are two ways to avoid random-value-induced mismatches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Use <code>v-if</code> + <code>onMounted</code> to render the part that depends on random values only on the client. Your framework may also have built-in features to make this easier, for example the <code>&lt;ClientOnly&gt;</code> component in VitePress.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use a random number generator library that supports generating with seeds, and guarantee the server run and the client run are using the same seed (e.g. by including the seed in serialized state and retrieving it on the client).</p></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p>The server and the client are in different time zones. Sometimes, we may want to convert a timestamp into the user's local time. However, the timezone during the server run and the timezone during the client run are not always the same, and we may not reliably know the user's timezone during the server run. In such cases, the local time conversion should also be performed as a client-only operation.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When Vue encounters a hydration mismatch, it will attempt to automatically recover and adjust the pre-rendered DOM to match the client-side state. This will lead to some rendering performance loss due to incorrect nodes being discarded and new nodes being mounted, but in most cases, the app should continue to work as expected. That said, it is still best to eliminate hydration mismatches during development.</p>\n<h4 id=\"suppressing-hydration-mismatches\" tabindex=\"-1\">Suppressing Hydration Mismatches  </h4>\n<p>In Vue 3.5+, it is possible to selectively suppress inevitable hydration mismatches by using the <a href=\"../../api/ssr#data-allow-mismatch\"><code>data-allow-mismatch</code></a> attribute.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-directives\" tabindex=\"-1\">Custom Directives </h3>\n<p>Since most custom directives involve direct DOM manipulation, they are ignored during SSR. However, if you want to specify how a custom directive should be rendered (i.e. what attributes it should add to the rendered element), you can use the <code>getSSRProps</code> directive hook:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const myDirective = {\n  mounted(el, binding) {\n    // client-side implementation:\n    // directly update the DOM\n    el.id = binding.value\n  },\n  getSSRProps(binding) {\n    // server-side implementation:\n    // return the props to be rendered.\n    // getSSRProps only receives the directive binding.\n    return {\n      id: binding.value\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"teleports\" tabindex=\"-1\">Teleports </h3>\n<p>Teleports require special handling during SSR. If the rendered app contains Teleports, the teleported content will not be part of the rendered string. An easier solution is to conditionally render the Teleport on mount.</p>\n<p>If you do need to hydrate teleported content, they are exposed under the <code>teleports</code> property of the ssr context object:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const ctx = {}\nconst html = await renderToString(app, ctx)\n\nconsole.log(ctx.teleports) // { '#teleported': 'teleported content' }</pre>\n<p>You need to inject the teleport markup into the correct location in your final page HTML similar to how you need to inject the main app markup.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Avoid targeting <code>body</code> when using Teleports and SSR together - usually, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> will contain other server-rendered content which makes it impossible for Teleports to determine the correct starting location for hydration.</p>\n<p>Instead, prefer a dedicated container, e.g. <code>&lt;div id=\"teleported\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> which contains only teleported content.</p>\n</div><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue":"<h1 id=\"ways-of-using-vue\" tabindex=\"-1\">Ways of Using Vue </h1>\n<p>We believe there is no \"one size fits all\" story for the web. This is why Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways to strike the optimal balance between stack complexity, developer experience and end performance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"standalone-script\" tabindex=\"-1\">Standalone Script </h2>\n<p>Vue can be used as a standalone script file - no build step required! If you have a backend framework already rendering most of the HTML, or your frontend logic isn't complex enough to justify a build step, this is the easiest way to integrate Vue into your stack. You can think of Vue as a more declarative replacement of jQuery in such cases.</p>\n<p>Vue also provides an alternative distribution called <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">petite-vue</a> that is specifically optimized for progressively enhancing existing HTML. It has a smaller feature set, but is extremely lightweight and uses an implementation that is more efficient in no-build-step scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"embedded-web-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Embedded Web Components </h2>\n<p>You can use Vue to <a href=\"web-components\">build standard Web Components</a> that can be embedded in any HTML page, regardless of how they are rendered. This option allows you to leverage Vue in a completely consumer-agnostic fashion: the resulting web components can be embedded in legacy applications, static HTML, or even applications built with other frameworks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"single-page-application-spa\" tabindex=\"-1\">Single-Page Application (SPA) </h2>\n<p>Some applications require rich interactivity, deep session depth, and non-trivial stateful logic on the frontend. The best way to build such applications is to use an architecture where Vue not only controls the entire page, but also handles data updates and navigation without having to reload the page. This type of application is typically referred to as a Single-Page Application (SPA).</p>\n<p>Vue provides core libraries and <a href=\"../scaling-up/tooling\">comprehensive tooling support</a> with amazing developer experience for building modern SPAs, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Client-side router</li>\n<li>Blazing fast build tool chain</li>\n<li>IDE support</li>\n<li>Browser devtools</li>\n<li>TypeScript integrations</li>\n<li>Testing utilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SPAs typically require the backend to expose API endpoints - but you can also pair Vue with solutions like <a href=\"https://inertiajs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Inertia.js</a> to get the SPA benefits while retaining a server-centric development model.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fullstack-ssr\" tabindex=\"-1\">Fullstack / SSR </h2>\n<p>Pure client-side SPAs are problematic when the app is sensitive to SEO and time-to-content. This is because the browser will receive a largely empty HTML page, and has to wait until the JavaScript is loaded before rendering anything.</p>\n<p>Vue provides first-class APIs to \"render\" a Vue app into HTML strings on the server. This allows the server to send back already-rendered HTML, allowing end users to see the content immediately while the JavaScript is being downloaded. Vue will then \"hydrate\" the application on the client side to make it interactive. This is called <a href=\"../scaling-up/ssr\">Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</a> and it greatly improves Core Web Vital metrics such as <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a>.</p>\n<p>There are higher-level Vue-based frameworks built on top of this paradigm, such as <a href=\"https://nuxt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nuxt</a>, which allow you to develop a fullstack application using Vue and JavaScript.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jamstack-ssg\" tabindex=\"-1\">JAMStack / SSG </h2>\n<p>Server-side rendering can be done ahead of time if the required data is static. This means we can pre-render an entire application into HTML and serve them as static files. This improves site performance and makes deployment a lot simpler since we no longer need to dynamically render pages on each request. Vue can still hydrate such applications to provide rich interactivity on the client. This technique is commonly referred to as Static-Site Generation (SSG), also known as <a href=\"https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JAMStack</a>.</p>\n<p>There are two flavors of SSG: single-page and multi-page. Both flavors pre-render the site into static HTML, the difference is that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>After the initial page load, a single-page SSG \"hydrates\" the page into an SPA. This requires more upfront JS payload and hydration cost, but subsequent navigations will be faster, since it only needs to partially update the page content instead of reloading the entire page.</p></li>\n<li><p>A multi-page SSG loads a new page on every navigation. The upside is that it can ship minimal JS - or no JS at all if the page requires no interaction! Some multi-page SSG frameworks such as <a href=\"https://astro.build/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Astro</a> also support \"partial hydration\" - which allows you to use Vue components to create interactive \"islands\" inside static HTML.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Single-page SSGs are better suited if you expect non-trivial interactivity, deep session lengths, or persisted elements / state across navigations. Otherwise, multi-page SSG would be the better choice.</p>\n<p>The Vue team also maintains a static-site generator called <a href=\"https://vitepress.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VitePress</a>, which powers this website you are reading right now! VitePress supports both flavors of SSG. <a href=\"https://nuxt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nuxt</a> also supports SSG.

It is an umbrella term that covers the following APIs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"../../api/reactivity-core\">Reactivity API</a>, e.g. <code>ref()</code> and <code>reactive()</code>, that allows us to directly create reactive state, computed state, and watchers.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"../../api/composition-api-lifecycle\">Lifecycle Hooks</a>, e.g. <code>onMounted()</code> and <code>onUnmounted()</code>, that allow us to programmatically hook into the component lifecycle.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"../../api/composition-api-dependency-injection\">Dependency Injection</a>, i.e. <code>provide()</code> and <code>inject()</code>, that allow us to leverage Vue's dependency injection system while using Reactivity APIs.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Composition API is a built-in feature of Vue 3 and <a href=\"https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-7-naruto.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue 2.7</a>. For older Vue 2 versions, use the officially maintained <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>@vue/composition-api</code></a> plugin. In Vue 3, it is also primarily used together with the <a href=\"../../api/sfc-script-setup\"><code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code></a> syntax in Single-File Components. Here's a basic example of a component using Composition API:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\n// reactive state\nconst count = ref(0)\n\n// functions that mutate state and trigger updates\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++\n}\n\n// lifecycle hooks\nonMounted(() =&gt; {\n  console.log(`The initial count is ${count.value}.`)\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"increment\"&gt;Count is: {{ count }}&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>Despite an API style based on function composition, <strong>Composition API is NOT functional programming</strong>. Composition API is based on Vue's mutable, fine-grained reactivity paradigm, whereas functional programming emphasizes immutability.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning how to use Vue with Composition API, you can set the site-wide API preference to Composition API using the toggle at the top of the left sidebar, and then go through the guide from the beginning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-composition-api\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why Composition API? </h2>\n<h3 id=\"better-logic-reuse\" tabindex=\"-1\">Better Logic Reuse </h3>\n<p>The primary advantage of Composition API is that it enables clean, efficient logic reuse in the form of <a href=\"../reusability/composables\">Composable functions</a>. It solves <a href=\"../reusability/composables#vs-mixins\">all the drawbacks of mixins</a>, the primary logic reuse mechanism for Options API.</p>\n<p>Composition API's logic reuse capability has given rise to impressive community projects such as <a href=\"https://vueuse.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VueUse</a>, an ever-growing collection of composable utilities. It also serves as a clean mechanism for easily integrating stateful third-party services or libraries into Vue's reactivity system, for example <a href=\"reactivity-in-depth#immutable-data\">immutable data</a>, <a href=\"reactivity-in-depth#state-machines\">state machines</a>, and <a href=\"reactivity-in-depth#rxjs\">RxJS</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-flexible-code-organization\" tabindex=\"-1\">More Flexible Code Organization </h3>\n<p>Many users love that we write organized code by default with Options API: everything has its place based on the option it falls under. However, Options API poses serious limitations when a single component's logic grows beyond a certain complexity threshold. This limitation is particularly prominent in components that need to deal with multiple <strong>logical concerns</strong>, which we have witnessed first hand in many production Vue 2 apps.</p>\n<p>Take the folder explorer component from Vue CLI's GUI as an example: this component is responsible for the following logical concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tracking current folder state and displaying its content</li>\n<li>Handling folder navigation (opening, closing, refreshing...)</li>\n<li>Handling new folder creation</li>\n<li>Toggling show favorite folders only</li>\n<li>Toggling show hidden folders</li>\n<li>Handling current working directory changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/a09407dd5b9f18ace7501ddb603b95e31d6d93c0/packages/@vue/cli-ui/src/components/folder/FolderExplorer.vue#L198-L404\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">original version</a> of the component was written in Options API.

width=\"129\" height=\"500\" style=\"margin:1.2em auto;\"><p>Notice how code dealing with the same logical concern is forced to be split under different options, located in different parts of the file. In a component that is several hundred lines long, understanding and navigating a single logical concern requires constantly scrolling up and down the file, making it much more difficult than it should be. In addition, if we ever intend to extract a logical concern into a reusable utility, it takes quite a bit of work to find and extract the right pieces of code from different parts of the file.</p>\n<p>Here's the same component, before and after the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/yyx990803/8854f8f6a97631576c14b63c8acd8f2e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">refactor into Composition API</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://vuejs.org/assets/composition-api-after.ZXskY_32.png\" alt=\"folder component after\"></p>\n<p>Notice how the code related to the same logical concern can now be grouped together: we no longer need to jump between different options blocks while working on a specific logical concern. Moreover, we can now move a group of code into an external file with minimal effort, since we no longer need to shuffle the code around in order to extract them. This reduced friction for refactoring is key to the long-term maintainability in large codebases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"better-type-inference\" tabindex=\"-1\">Better Type Inference </h3>\n<p>In recent years, more and more frontend developers are adopting <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TypeScript</a> as it helps us write more robust code, make changes with more confidence, and provides a great development experience with IDE support. However, the Options API, originally conceived in 2013, was designed without type inference in mind. We had to implement some <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/44b95276f5c086e1d88fa3c686a5f39eb5bb7821/packages/runtime-core/src/componentPublicInstance.ts#L132-L165\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">absurdly complex type gymnastics</a> to make type inference work with the Options API. Even with all this effort, type inference for Options API can still break down for mixins and dependency injection.</p>\n<p>This had led many developers who wanted to use Vue with TS to lean towards Class API powered by <code>vue-class-component</code>. However, a class-based API heavily relies on ES decorators, a language feature that was only a stage 2 proposal when Vue 3 was being developed in 2019. We felt it was too risky to base an official API on an unstable proposal. Since then, the decorators proposal has gone through yet another complete overhaul, and finally reached stage 3 in 2022. In addition, class-based API suffers from logic reuse and organization limitations similar to Options API.</p>\n<p>In comparison, Composition API utilizes mostly plain variables and functions, which are naturally type friendly. Code written in Composition API can enjoy full type inference with little need for manual type hints. Most of the time, Composition API code will look largely identical in TypeScript and plain JavaScript. This also makes it possible for plain JavaScript users to benefit from partial type inference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"smaller-production-bundle-and-less-overhead\" tabindex=\"-1\">Smaller Production Bundle and Less Overhead </h3>\n<p>Code written in Composition API and <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> is also more efficient and minification-friendly than Options API equivalent. This is because the template in a <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> component is compiled as a function inlined in the same scope of the <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> code. Unlike property access from <code>this</code>, the compiled template code can directly access variables declared inside <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, without an instance proxy in between. This also leads to better minification because all the variable names can be safely shortened.</p>\n<h2 id=\"relationship-with-options-api\" tabindex=\"-1\">Relationship with Options API </h2>\n<h3 id=\"trade-offs\" tabindex=\"-1\">Trade-offs </h3>\n<p>Some users moving from Options API found their Composition API code less organized, and concluded that Composition API is \"worse\" in terms of code organization. We recommend users with such opinions to look at that problem from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>It is true that Composition API no longer provides the \"guard rails\" that guide you to put your code into respective buckets. In return, you get to author component code like how you would write normal JavaScript. This means <strong>you can and should apply any code organization best practices to your Composition API code as you would when writing normal JavaScript</strong>. If you can write well-organized JavaScript, you should also be able to write well-organized Composition API code.</p>\n<p>Options API does allow you to \"think less\" when writing component code, which is why many users love it. However, in reducing the mental overhead, it also locks you into the prescribed code organization pattern with no escape hatch, which can make it difficult to refactor or improve code quality in larger scale projects. In this regard, Composition API provides better long term scalability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"does-composition-api-cover-all-use-cases\" tabindex=\"-1\">Does Composition API cover all use cases? </h3>\n<p>Yes in terms of stateful logic. When using Composition API, there are only a few options that may still be needed: <code>props</code>, <code>emits</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>inheritAttrs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Since 3.3 you can directly use <code>defineOptions</code> in <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> to set the component name or <code>inheritAttrs</code> property</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you intend to exclusively use Composition API (along with the options listed above), you can shave a few kbs off your production bundle via a <a href=\"../../api/compile-time-flags\">compile-time flag</a> that drops Options API related code from Vue. Note this also affects Vue components in your dependencies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-use-both-apis-in-the-same-component\" tabindex=\"-1\">Can I use both APIs in the same component? </h3>\n<p>Yes. You can use Composition API via the <a href=\"../../api/composition-api-setup\"><code>setup()</code></a> option in an Options API component.</p>\n<p>However, we only recommend doing so if you have an existing Options API codebase that needs to integrate with new features / external libraries written with Composition API.</p>\n<h3 id=\"will-options-api-be-deprecated\" tabindex=\"-1\">Will Options API be deprecated? </h3>\n<p>No, we do not have any plan to do so. Options API is an integral part of Vue and the reason many developers love it. We also realize that many of the benefits of Composition API only manifest in larger-scale projects, and Options API remains a solid choice for many low-to-medium-complexity scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"relationship-with-class-api\" tabindex=\"-1\">Relationship with Class API </h2>\n<p>We no longer recommend using Class API with Vue 3, given that Composition API provides great TypeScript integration with additional logic reuse and code organization benefits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comparison-with-react-hooks\" tabindex=\"-1\">Comparison with React Hooks </h2>\n<p>Composition API provides the same level of logic composition capabilities as React Hooks, but with some important differences.</p>\n<p>React Hooks are invoked repeatedly every time a component updates. This creates a number of caveats that can confuse even seasoned React developers. It also leads to performance optimization issues that can severely affect development experience. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Hooks are call-order sensitive and cannot be conditional.</p></li>\n<li><p>Variables declared in a React component can be captured by a hook closure and become \"stale\" if the developer fails to pass in the correct dependencies array. This leads to React developers relying on ESLint rules to ensure correct dependencies are passed. However, the rule is often not smart enough and over-compensates for correctness, which leads to unnecessary invalidation and headaches when edge cases are encountered.</p></li>\n<li><p>Expensive computations require the use of <code>useMemo</code>, which again requires manually passing in the correct dependencies array.</p></li>\n<li><p>Event handlers passed to child components cause unnecessary child updates by default, and require explicit <code>useCallback</code> as an optimization. This is almost always needed, and again requires a correct dependencies array. Neglecting this leads to over-rendering apps by default and can cause performance issues without realizing it.</p></li>\n<li><p>The stale closure problem, combined with Concurrent features, makes it difficult to reason about when a piece of hooks code is run, and makes working with mutable state that should persist across renders (via <code>useRef</code>) cumbersome.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>Note: some of the above issues that are related to memoization can be resolved by the upcoming <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">React Compiler</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In comparison, Vue Composition API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Invokes <code>setup()</code> or <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> code only once. This makes the code align better with the intuitions of idiomatic JavaScript usage as there are no stale closures to worry about. Composition API calls are also not sensitive to call order and can be conditional.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vue's runtime reactivity system automatically collects reactive dependencies used in computed properties and watchers, so there's no need to manually declare dependencies.</p></li>\n<li><p>No need to manually cache callback functions to avoid unnecessary child updates. In general, Vue's fine-grained reactivity system ensures child components only update when they need to. Manual child-update optimizations are rarely a concern for Vue developers.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We acknowledge the creativity of React Hooks, and it is a major source of inspiration for Composition API. However, the issues mentioned above do exist in its design and we noticed Vue's reactivity model happens to provide a way around them.</p><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/typescript/composition-api":"<h1 id=\"typescript-with-composition-api\" tabindex=\"-1\">TypeScript with Composition API </h1>\n<div class=\"scrimba\" type=\"scrimba\" data-v-7a8c3350><a href=\"https://scrimba.com/links/vue-ts-composition-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" title=\"Free Vue.js TypeScript with Composition API Lesson\" data-v-7a8c3350> Watch an interactive video lesson on Scrimba </a></div>\n<blockquote><p>This page assumes you've already read the overview on <a href=\"overview\">Using Vue with TypeScript</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"typing-component-props\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing Component Props </h2>\n<h3 id=\"using-script-setup\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> </h3>\n<p>When using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, the <code>defineProps()</code> macro supports inferring the props types based on its argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\nconst props = defineProps({\n  foo: { type: String, required: true },\n  bar: Number\n})\n\nprops.foo // string\nprops.bar // number | undefined\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>This is called \"runtime declaration\", because the argument passed to <code>defineProps()</code> will be used as the runtime <code>props</code> option.</p>\n<p>However, it is usually more straightforward to define props with pure types via a generic type argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\nconst props = defineProps&lt;{\n  foo: string\n  bar?: number\n}&gt;()\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>This is called \"type-based declaration\". The compiler will try to do its best to infer the equivalent runtime options based on the type argument. In this case, our second example compiles into the exact same runtime options as the first example.</p>\n<p>You can use either type-based declaration OR runtime declaration, but you cannot use both at the same time.</p>\n<p>We can also move the props types into a separate interface:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\ninterface Props {\n  foo: string\n  bar?: number\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps&lt;Props&gt;()\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>This also works if <code>Props</code> is imported from an external source. This feature requires TypeScript to be a peer dependency of Vue.</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\nimport type { Props } from './foo'\n\nconst props = defineProps&lt;Props&gt;()\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<h4 id=\"syntax-limitations\" tabindex=\"-1\">Syntax Limitations </h4>\n<p>In version 3.2 and below, the generic type parameter for <code>defineProps()</code> were limited to a type literal or a reference to a local interface.</p>\n<p>This limitation has been resolved in 3.3. The latest version of Vue supports referencing imported and a limited set of complex types in the type parameter position. However, because the type to runtime conversion is still AST-based, some complex types that require actual type analysis, e.g. conditional types, are not supported. You can use conditional types for the type of a single prop, but not the entire props object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"props-default-values\" tabindex=\"-1\">Props Default Values </h3>\n<p>When using type-based declaration, we lose the ability to declare default values for the props. This can be resolved by using <a href=\"../components/props#reactive-props-destructure\">Reactive Props Destructure</a> :</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface Props {\n  msg?: string\n  labels?: string[]\n}\n\nconst { msg = 'hello', labels = ['one', 'two'] } = defineProps&lt;Props&gt;()</pre>\n<p>In 3.4 and below, Reactive Props Destructure is not enabled by default. An alternative is to use the <code>withDefaults</code> compiler macro:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface Props {\n  msg?: string\n  labels?: string[]\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps&lt;Props&gt;(), {\n  msg: 'hello',\n  labels: () =&gt; ['one', 'two']\n})</pre>\n<p>This will be compiled to equivalent runtime props <code>default</code> options. In addition, the <code>withDefaults</code> helper provides type checks for the default values, and ensures the returned <code>props</code> type has the optional flags removed for properties that do have default values declared.</p>\n<div class=\"info custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">INFO</strong><p>Note that default values for mutable reference types (like arrays or objects) should be wrapped in functions when using <code>withDefaults</code> to avoid accidental modification and external side effects. This ensures each component instance gets its own copy of the default value. This is <strong>not</strong> necessary when using default values with destructure.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"without-script-setup\" tabindex=\"-1\">Without <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> </h3>\n<p>If not using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, it is necessary to use <code>defineComponent()</code> to enable props type inference. The type of the props object passed to <code>setup()</code> is inferred from the <code>props</code> option.</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  props: {\n    message: String\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    props.message // &lt;-- type: string\n  }\n})</pre>\n<h3 id=\"complex-prop-types\" tabindex=\"-1\">Complex prop types </h3>\n<p>With type-based declaration, a prop can use a complex type much like any other type:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\ninterface Book {\n  title: string\n  author: string\n  year: number\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps&lt;{\n  book: Book\n}&gt;()\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>For runtime declaration, we can use the <code>PropType</code> utility type:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\nconst props = defineProps({\n  book: Object as PropType&lt;Book&gt;\n})</pre>\n<p>This works in much the same way if we're specifying the <code>props</code> option directly:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\nimport type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  props: {\n    book: Object as PropType&lt;Book&gt;\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>The <code>props</code> option is more commonly used with the Options API, so you'll find more detailed examples in the guide to <a href=\"options-api#typing-component-props\">TypeScript with Options API</a>. The techniques shown in those examples also apply to runtime declarations using <code>defineProps()</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typing-component-emits\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing Component Emits </h2>\n<p>In <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, the <code>emit</code> function can also be typed using either runtime declaration OR type declaration:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\n// runtime\nconst emit = defineEmits(['change', 'update'])\n\n// options based\nconst emit = defineEmits({\n  change: (id: number) =&gt; {\n    // return `true` or `false` to indicate\n    // validation pass / fail\n  },\n  update: (value: string) =&gt; {\n    // return `true` or `false` to indicate\n    // validation pass / fail\n  }\n})\n\n// type-based\nconst emit = defineEmits&lt;{\n  (e: 'change', id: number): void\n  (e: 'update', value: string): void\n}&gt;()\n\n// 3.3+: alternative, more succinct syntax\nconst emit = defineEmits&lt;{\n  change: [id: number]\n  update: [value: string]\n}&gt;()\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>The type argument can be one of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A callable function type, but written as a type literal with <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#call-signatures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Call Signatures</a>. It will be used as the type of the returned <code>emit</code> function.</li>\n<li>A type literal where the keys are the event names, and values are array / tuple types representing the additional accepted parameters for the event. The example above is using named tuples so each argument can have an explicit name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we can see, the type declaration gives us much finer-grained control over the type constraints of emitted events.</p>\n<p>When not using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, <code>defineComponent()</code> is able to infer the allowed events for the <code>emit</code> function exposed on the setup context:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  emits: ['change'],\n  setup(props, { emit }) {\n    emit('change') // &lt;-- type check / auto-completion\n  }\n})</pre>\n<h2 id=\"typing-ref\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing <code>ref()</code> </h2>\n<p>Refs infer the type from the initial value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { ref } from 'vue'\n\n// inferred type: Ref&lt;number&gt;\nconst year = ref(2020)\n\n// =&gt; TS Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.\nyear.value = '2020'</pre>\n<p>Sometimes we may need to specify complex types for a ref's inner value. We can do that by using the <code>Ref</code> type:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { ref } from 'vue'\nimport type { Ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst year: Ref&lt;string | number&gt; = ref('2020')\n\nyear.value = 2020 // ok!</pre>\n<p>Or, by passing a generic argument when calling <code>ref()</code> to override the default inference:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">// resulting type: Ref&lt;string | number&gt;\nconst year = ref&lt;string | number&gt;('2020')\n\nyear.value = 2020 // ok!</pre>\n<p>If you specify a generic type argument but omit the initial value, the resulting type will be a union type that includes <code>undefined</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">// inferred type: Ref&lt;number | undefined&gt;\nconst n = ref&lt;number&gt;()</pre>\n<h2 id=\"typing-reactive\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing <code>reactive()</code> </h2>\n<p><code>reactive()</code> also implicitly infers the type from its argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { reactive } from 'vue'\n\n// inferred type: { title: string }\nconst book = reactive({ title: 'Vue 3 Guide' })</pre>\n<p>To explicitly type a <code>reactive</code> property, we can use interfaces:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { reactive } from 'vue'\n\ninterface Book {\n  title: string\n  year?: number\n}\n\nconst book: Book = reactive({ title: 'Vue 3 Guide' })</pre>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>It's not recommended to use the generic argument of <code>reactive()</code> because the returned type, which handles nested ref unwrapping, is different from the generic argument type.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"typing-computed\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing <code>computed()</code> </h2>\n<p><code>computed()</code> infers its type based on the getter's return value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { ref, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n\n// inferred type: ComputedRef&lt;number&gt;\nconst double = computed(() =&gt; count.value * 2)\n\n// =&gt; TS Error: Property 'split' does not exist on type 'number'\nconst result = double.value.split('')</pre>\n<p>You can also specify an explicit type via a generic argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const double = computed&lt;number&gt;(() =&gt; {\n  // type error if this doesn't return a number\n})</pre>\n<h2 id=\"typing-event-handlers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing Event Handlers </h2>\n<p>When dealing with native DOM events, it might be useful to type the argument we pass to the handler correctly. Let's take a look at this example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\nfunction handleChange(event) {\n  // `event` implicitly has `any` type\n  console.log(event.target.value)\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"text\" @change=\"handleChange\" /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>Without type annotation, the <code>event</code> argument will implicitly have a type of <code>any</code>. This will also result in a TS error if <code>\"strict\": true</code> or <code>\"noImplicitAny\": true</code> are used in <code>tsconfig.json</code>. It is therefore recommended to explicitly annotate the argument of event handlers. In addition, you may need to use type assertions when accessing the properties of <code>event</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">function handleChange(event: Event) {\n  console.log((event.target as HTMLInputElement).value)\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"typing-provide-inject\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing Provide / Inject </h2>\n<p>Provide and inject are usually performed in separate components. To properly type injected values, Vue provides an <code>InjectionKey</code> interface, which is a generic type that extends <code>Symbol</code>. It can be used to sync the type of the injected value between the provider and the consumer:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { provide, inject } from 'vue'\nimport type { InjectionKey } from 'vue'\n\nconst key = Symbol() as InjectionKey&lt;string&gt;\n\nprovide(key, 'foo') // providing non-string value will result in error\n\nconst foo = inject(key) // type of foo: string | undefined</pre>\n<p>It's recommended to place the injection key in a separate file so that it can be imported in multiple components.</p>\n<p>When using string injection keys, the type of the injected value will be <code>unknown</code>, and needs to be explicitly declared via a generic type argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const foo = inject&lt;string&gt;('foo') // type: string | undefined</pre>\n<p>Notice the injected value can still be <code>undefined</code>, because there is no guarantee that a provider will provide this value at runtime.</p>\n<p>The <code>undefined</code> type can be removed by providing a default value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const foo = inject&lt;string&gt;('foo', 'bar') // type: string</pre>\n<p>If you are sure that the value is always provided, you can also force cast the value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const foo = inject('foo') as string</pre>\n<h2 id=\"typing-template-refs\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing Template Refs </h2>\n<p>With Vue 3.5 and <code>@vue/language-tools</code> 2.1 (powering both the IDE language service and <code>vue-tsc</code>), the type of refs created by <code>useTemplateRef()</code> in SFCs can be <strong>automatically inferred</strong> for static refs based on what element the matching <code>ref</code> attribute is used on.</p>\n<p>In cases where auto-inference is not possible, you can still cast the template ref to an explicit type via the generic argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const el = useTemplateRef&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;('el')</pre>\n<div>\n<summary>Usage before 3.5</summary><p>Template refs should be created with an explicit generic type argument and an initial value of <code>null</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'\n\nconst el = ref&lt;HTMLInputElement | null&gt;(null)\n\nonMounted(() =&gt; {\n  el.value?.focus()\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;input ref=\"el\" /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n</div>\n<p>To get the right DOM interface you can check pages like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#technical_summary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MDN</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that for strict type safety, it is necessary to use optional chaining or type guards when accessing <code>el.value</code>.

With it, Vue is able to infer the types for the props based on the <code>props</code> option, taking additional options such as <code>required: true</code> and <code>default</code> into account:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  // type inference enabled\n  props: {\n    name: String,\n    id: [Number, String],\n    msg: { type: String, required: true },\n    metadata: null\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.name // type: string | undefined\n    this.id // type: number | string | undefined\n    this.msg // type: string\n    this.metadata // type: any\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>However, the runtime <code>props</code> options only support using constructor functions as a prop's type - there is no way to specify complex types such as objects with nested properties or function call signatures.</p>\n<p>To annotate complex props types, we can use the <code>PropType</code> utility type:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\nimport type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\ninterface Book {\n  title: string\n  author: string\n  year: number\n}\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  props: {\n    book: {\n      // provide more specific type to `Object`\n      type: Object as PropType&lt;Book&gt;,\n      required: true\n    },\n    // can also annotate functions\n    callback: Function as PropType&lt;(id: number) =&gt; void&gt;\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.book.title // string\n    this.book.year // number\n\n    // TS Error: argument of type 'string' is not\n    // assignable to parameter of type 'number'\n    this.callback?.('123')\n  }\n})</pre>\n<h3 id=\"caveats\" tabindex=\"-1\">Caveats </h3>\n<p>If your TypeScript version is less than <code>4.7</code>, you have to be careful when using function values for <code>validator</code> and <code>default</code> prop options - make sure to use arrow functions:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\nimport type { PropType } from 'vue'\n\ninterface Book {\n  title: string\n  year?: number\n}\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  props: {\n    bookA: {\n      type: Object as PropType&lt;Book&gt;,\n      // Make sure to use arrow functions if your TypeScript version is less than 4.7\n      default: () =&gt; ({\n        title: 'Arrow Function Expression'\n      }),\n      validator: (book: Book) =&gt; !!book.title\n    }\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>This prevents TypeScript from having to infer the type of <code>this</code> inside these functions, which, unfortunately, can cause the type inference to fail.

Also, all non-declared emitted events will throw a type error when called:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  emits: {\n    addBook(payload: { bookName: string }) {\n      // perform runtime validation\n      return payload.bookName.length &gt; 0\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    onSubmit() {\n      this.$emit('addBook', {\n        bookName: 123 // Type error!\n      })\n\n      this.$emit('non-declared-event') // Type error!\n    }\n  }\n})</pre>\n<h2 id=\"typing-computed-properties\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing Computed Properties </h2>\n<p>A computed property infers its type based on its return value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello!'\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    greeting() {\n      return this.message + '!'\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.greeting // type: string\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>In some cases, you may want to explicitly annotate the type of a computed property to ensure its implementation is correct:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  data() {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello!'\n    }\n  },\n  computed: {\n    // explicitly annotate return type\n    greeting(): string {\n      return this.message + '!'\n    },\n\n    // annotating a writable computed property\n    greetingUppercased: {\n      get(): string {\n        return this.greeting.toUpperCase()\n      },\n      set(newValue: string) {\n        this.message = newValue.toUpperCase()\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>Explicit annotations may also be required in some edge cases where TypeScript fails to infer the type of a computed property due to circular inference loops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typing-event-handlers\" tabindex=\"-1\">Typing Event Handlers </h2>\n<p>When dealing with native DOM events, it might be useful to type the argument we pass to the handler correctly. Let's take a look at this example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script lang=\"ts\"&gt;\nimport { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  methods: {\n    handleChange(event) {\n      // `event` implicitly has `any` type\n      console.log(event.target.value)\n    }\n  }\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"text\" @change=\"handleChange\" /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>Without type annotation, the <code>event</code> argument will implicitly have a type of <code>any</code>. This will also result in a TS error if <code>\"strict\": true</code> or <code>\"noImplicitAny\": true</code> are used in <code>tsconfig.json</code>. It is therefore recommended to explicitly annotate the argument of event handlers. In addition, you may need to use type assertions when accessing the properties of <code>event</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  methods: {\n    handleChange(event: Event) {\n      console.log((event.target as HTMLInputElement).value)\n    }\n  }\n})</pre>\n<h2 id=\"augmenting-global-properties\" tabindex=\"-1\">Augmenting Global Properties </h2>\n<p>Some plugins install globally available properties to all component instances via <a href=\"../../api/application#app-config-globalproperties\"><code>app.config.globalProperties</code></a>. For example, we may install <code>this.$http</code> for data-fetching or <code>this.$translate</code> for internationalization. To make this play well with TypeScript, Vue exposes a <code>ComponentCustomProperties</code> interface designed to be augmented via <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TypeScript module augmentation</a>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import axios from 'axios'\n\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface ComponentCustomProperties {\n    $http: typeof axios\n    $translate: (key: string) =&gt; string\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages-private/dts-test/componentTypeExtensions.test-d.tsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TypeScript unit tests for component type extensions</a></li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"type-augmentation-placement\" tabindex=\"-1\">Type Augmentation Placement </h3>\n<p>We can put this type augmentation in a <code>.ts</code> file, or in a project-wide <code>*.d.ts</code> file. Either way, make sure it is included in <code>tsconfig.json</code>. For library / plugin authors, this file should be specified in the <code>types</code> property in <code>package.json</code>.</p>\n<p>In order to take advantage of module augmentation, you will need to ensure the augmentation is placed in a <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TypeScript module</a>. That is to say, the file needs to contain at least one top-level <code>import</code> or <code>export</code>, even if it is just <code>export {}</code>. If the augmentation is placed outside of a module, it will overwrite the original types rather than augmenting them!</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">// Does not work, overwrites the original types.\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface ComponentCustomProperties {\n    $translate: (key: string) =&gt; string\n  }\n}</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">// Works correctly\nexport {}\n\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface ComponentCustomProperties {\n    $translate: (key: string) =&gt; string\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"augmenting-custom-options\" tabindex=\"-1\">Augmenting Custom Options </h2>\n<p>Some plugins, for example <code>vue-router</code>, provide support for custom component options such as <code>beforeRouteEnter</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { defineComponent } from 'vue'\n\nexport default defineComponent({\n  beforeRouteEnter(to, from, next) {\n    // ...\n  }\n})</pre>\n<p>Without proper type augmentation, the arguments of this hook will implicitly have <code>any</code> type. We can augment the <code>ComponentCustomOptions</code> interface to support these custom options:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">import { Route } from 'vue-router'\n\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface ComponentCustomOptions {\n    beforeRouteEnter?(to: Route, from: Route, next: () =&gt; void): void\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Now the <code>beforeRouteEnter</code> option will be properly typed. Note this is just an example - well-typed libraries like <code>vue-router</code> should automatically perform these augmentations in their own type definitions.</p>\n<p>The placement of this augmentation is subject to the <a href=\"#type-augmentation-placement\">same restrictions</a> as global property augmentations.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages-private/dts-test/componentTypeExtensions.test-d.tsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TypeScript unit tests for component type extensions</a></li></ul><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/options-api\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/options-api</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/extras/rendering-mechanism":"<h1 id=\"rendering-mechanism\" tabindex=\"-1\">Rendering Mechanism </h1>\n<p>How does Vue take a template and turn it into actual DOM nodes? How does Vue update those DOM nodes efficiently? We will attempt to shed some light on these questions here by diving into Vue's internal rendering mechanism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"virtual-dom\" tabindex=\"-1\">Virtual DOM </h2>\n<p>You have probably heard about the term \"virtual DOM\", which Vue's rendering system is based upon.</p>\n<p>The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM. The concept was pioneered by <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">React</a>, and has been adopted in many other frameworks with different implementations, including Vue.</p>\n<p>Virtual DOM is more of a pattern than a specific technology, so there is no one canonical implementation. We can illustrate the idea using a simple example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const vnode = {\n  type: 'div',\n  props: {\n    id: 'hello'\n  },\n  children: [\n    /* more vnodes */\n  ]\n}</pre>\n<p>Here, <code>vnode</code> is a plain JavaScript object (a \"virtual node\") representing a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. It contains all the information that we need to create the actual element. It also contains more children vnodes, which makes it the root of a virtual DOM tree.</p>\n<p>A runtime renderer can walk a virtual DOM tree and construct a real DOM tree from it. This process is called <strong>mount</strong>.</p>\n<p>If we have two copies of virtual DOM trees, the renderer can also walk and compare the two trees, figuring out the differences, and apply those changes to the actual DOM. This process is called <strong>patch</strong>, also known as \"diffing\" or \"reconciliation\".</p>\n<p>The main benefit of virtual DOM is that it gives the developer the ability to programmatically create, inspect and compose desired UI structures in a declarative way, while leaving the direct DOM manipulation to the renderer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"render-pipeline\" tabindex=\"-1\">Render Pipeline </h2>\n<p>At the high level, this is what happens when a Vue component is mounted:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Compile</strong>: Vue templates are compiled into <strong>render functions</strong>: functions that return virtual DOM trees. This step can be done either ahead-of-time via a build step, or on-the-fly by using the runtime compiler.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Mount</strong>: The runtime renderer invokes the render functions, walks the returned virtual DOM tree, and creates actual DOM nodes based on it. This step is performed as a <a href=\"reactivity-in-depth\">reactive effect</a>, so it keeps track of all reactive dependencies that were used.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Patch</strong>: When a dependency used during mount changes, the effect re-runs. This time, a new, updated Virtual DOM tree is created.

alt=\"render pipeline\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"templates-vs-render-functions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Templates vs. Render Functions </h2>\n<p>Vue templates are compiled into virtual DOM render functions. Vue also provides APIs that allow us to skip the template compilation step and directly author render functions. Render functions are more flexible than templates when dealing with highly dynamic logic, because you can work with vnodes using the full power of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>So why does Vue recommend templates by default? There are a number of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Templates are closer to actual HTML. This makes it easier to reuse existing HTML snippets, apply accessibility best practices, style with CSS, and for designers to understand and modify.</p></li>\n<li><p>Templates are easier to statically analyze due to their more deterministic syntax. This allows Vue's template compiler to apply many compile-time optimizations to improve the performance of the virtual DOM (which we will discuss below).</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In practice, templates are sufficient for most use cases in applications. Render functions are typically only used in reusable components that need to deal with highly dynamic rendering logic. Render function usage is discussed in more detail in <a href=\"render-function\">Render Functions &amp; JSX</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compiler-informed-virtual-dom\" tabindex=\"-1\">Compiler-Informed Virtual DOM </h2>\n<p>The virtual DOM implementation in React and most other virtual-DOM implementations are purely runtime: the reconciliation algorithm cannot make any assumptions about the incoming virtual DOM tree, so it has to fully traverse the tree and diff the props of every vnode in order to ensure correctness. In addition, even if a part of the tree never changes, new vnodes are always created for them on each re-render, resulting in unnecessary memory pressure. This is one of the most criticized aspect of virtual DOM: the somewhat brute-force reconciliation process sacrifices efficiency in return for declarativeness and correctness.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't have to be that way. In Vue, the framework controls both the compiler and the runtime. This allows us to implement many compile-time optimizations that only a tightly-coupled renderer can take advantage of. The compiler can statically analyze the template and leave hints in the generated code so that the runtime can take shortcuts whenever possible. At the same time, we still preserve the capability for the user to drop down to the render function layer for more direct control in edge cases. We call this hybrid approach <strong>Compiler-Informed Virtual DOM</strong>.</p>\n<p>Below, we will discuss a few major optimizations done by the Vue template compiler to improve the virtual DOM's runtime performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cache-static\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cache Static </h3>\n<p>Quite often there will be parts in a template that do not contain any dynamic bindings:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- cached --&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;bar&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- cached --&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;{{ dynamic }}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://template-explorer.vuejs.org/#eyJzcmMiOiI8ZGl2PlxuICA8ZGl2PmZvbzwvZGl2PiA8IS0tIGNhY2hlZCAtLT5cbiAgPGRpdj5iYXI8L2Rpdj4gPCEtLSBjYWNoZWQgLS0+XG4gIDxkaXY+e3sgZHluYW1pYyB9fTwvZGl2PlxuPC9kaXY+XG4iLCJvcHRpb25zIjp7ImhvaXN0U3RhdGljIjp0cnVlfX0=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Inspect in Template Explorer</a></p>\n<p>The <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> divs are static - re-creating vnodes and diffing them on each re-render is unnecessary. The renderer creates these vnodes during the initial render, caches them, and reuses the same vnodes for every subsequent re-render. The renderer is also able to completely skip diffing them when it notices the old vnode and the new vnode are the same one.</p>\n<p>In addition, when there are enough consecutive static elements, they will be condensed into a single \"static vnode\" that contains the plain HTML string for all these nodes (<a href=\"https://template-explorer.vuejs.org/#eyJzcmMiOiI8ZGl2PlxuICA8ZGl2IGNsYXNzPVwiZm9vXCI+Zm9vPC9kaXY+XG4gIDxkaXYgY2xhc3M9XCJmb29cIj5mb288L2Rpdj5cbiAgPGRpdiBjbGFzcz1cImZvb1wiPmZvbzwvZGl2PlxuICA8ZGl2IGNsYXNzPVwiZm9vXCI+Zm9vPC9kaXY+XG4gIDxkaXYgY2xhc3M9XCJmb29cIj5mb288L2Rpdj5cbiAgPGRpdj57eyBkeW5hbWljIH19PC9kaXY+XG48L2Rpdj4iLCJzc3IiOmZhbHNlLCJvcHRpb25zIjp7ImhvaXN0U3RhdGljIjp0cnVlfX0=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Example</a>). These static vnodes are mounted by directly setting <code>innerHTML</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patch-flags\" tabindex=\"-1\">Patch Flags </h3>\n<p>For a single element with dynamic bindings, we can also infer a lot of information from it at compile time:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;!-- class binding only --&gt;\n&lt;div :class=\"{ active }\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- id and value bindings only --&gt;\n&lt;input :id=\"id\" :value=\"value\"&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- text children only --&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;{{ dynamic }}&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://template-explorer.vuejs.org/#eyJzcmMiOiI8ZGl2IDpjbGFzcz1cInsgYWN0aXZlIH1cIj48L2Rpdj5cblxuPGlucHV0IDppZD1cImlkXCIgOnZhbHVlPVwidmFsdWVcIj5cblxuPGRpdj57eyBkeW5hbWljIH19PC9kaXY+Iiwib3B0aW9ucyI6e319\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Inspect in Template Explorer</a></p>\n<p>When generating the render function code for these elements, Vue encodes the type of update each of them needs directly in the vnode creation call:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">createElementVNode(\"div\", {\n  class: _normalizeClass({ active: _ctx.active })\n}, null, 2 /* CLASS */)</pre>\n<p>The last argument, <code>2</code>, is a <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/shared/src/patchFlags.ts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">patch flag</a>. An element can have multiple patch flags, which will be merged into a single number. The runtime renderer can then check against the flags using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bitwise operations</a> to determine whether it needs to do certain work:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">if (vnode.patchFlag &amp; PatchFlags.CLASS /* 2 */) {\n  // update the element's class\n}</pre>\n<p>Bitwise checks are extremely fast. With the patch flags, Vue is able to do the least amount of work necessary when updating elements with dynamic bindings.</p>\n<p>Vue also encodes the type of children a vnode has. For example, a template that has multiple root nodes is represented as a fragment. In most cases, we know for sure that the order of these root nodes will never change, so this information can also be provided to the runtime as a patch flag:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export function render() {\n  return (_openBlock(), _createElementBlock(_Fragment, null, [\n    /* children */\n  ], 64 /* STABLE_FRAGMENT */))\n}</pre>\n<p>The runtime can thus completely skip child-order reconciliation for the root fragment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tree-flattening\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tree Flattening </h3>\n<p>Taking another look at the generated code from the previous example, you'll notice the root of the returned virtual DOM tree is created using a special <code>createElementBlock()</code> call:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export function render() {\n  return (_openBlock(), _createElementBlock(_Fragment, null, [\n    /* children */\n  ], 64 /* STABLE_FRAGMENT */))\n}</pre>\n<p>Conceptually, a \"block\" is a part of the template that has stable inner structure. In this case, the entire template has a single block because it does not contain any structural directives like <code>v-if</code> and <code>v-for</code>.</p>\n<p>Each block tracks any descendant nodes (not just direct children) that have patch flags. For example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- root block --&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;         &lt;!-- not tracked --&gt;\n  &lt;div :id=\"id\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;!-- tracked --&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;                  &lt;!-- not tracked --&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;{{ bar }}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- tracked --&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>The result is a flattened array that contains only the dynamic descendant nodes:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"\">div (block root)\n- div with :id binding\n- div with {{ bar }} binding</pre>\n<p>When this component needs to re-render, it only needs to traverse the flattened tree instead of the full tree. This is called <strong>Tree Flattening</strong>, and it greatly reduces the number of nodes that need to be traversed during virtual DOM reconciliation. Any static parts of the template are effectively skipped.</p>\n<p><code>v-if</code> and <code>v-for</code> directives will create new block nodes:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- root block --&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div v-if&gt; &lt;!-- if block --&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>A child block is tracked inside the parent block's array of dynamic descendants. This retains a stable structure for the parent block.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact-on-ssr-hydration\" tabindex=\"-1\">Impact on SSR Hydration </h3>\n<p>Both patch flags and tree flattening also greatly improve Vue's <a href=\"../scaling-up/ssr#client-hydration\">SSR Hydration</a> performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Single element hydration can take fast paths based on the corresponding vnode's patch flag.</p></li>\n<li><p>Only block nodes and their dynamic descendants need to be traversed during hydration, effectively achieving partial hydration at the template level.</p></li>\n</ul><div class=\"_attribution\">\n  <p class=\"_attribution-p\">\n    &copy; 2013&ndash;present Yuxi Evan You<br>Licensed under the MIT License.<br>\n    <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/rendering-mechanism\" class=\"_attribution-link\">https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/rendering-mechanism</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n","guide/best-practices/accessibility":"<h1 id=\"accessibility\" tabindex=\"-1\">Accessibility </h1>\n<p>Web accessibility (also known as a11y) refers to the practice of creating websites that can be used by anyone — be that a person with a disability, a slow connection, outdated or broken hardware or simply someone in an unfavorable environment. For example, adding subtitles to a video would help both your deaf and hard-of-hearing users and your users who are in a loud environment and can't hear their phone. Similarly, making sure your text isn't too low contrast will help both your low-vision users and your users who are trying to use their phone in bright sunlight.</p>\n<p>Ready to start but aren’t sure where?</p>\n<p>Checkout the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Planning and managing web accessibility guide</a> provided by <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"skip-link\" tabindex=\"-1\">Skip link </h2>\n<p>You should add a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area so users can skip content that is repeated on multiple Web pages.</p>\n<p>Typically this is done on the top of <code>App.vue</code> as it will be the first focusable element on all your pages:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;span ref=\"backToTop\" tabindex=\"-1\" /&gt;\n&lt;ul class=\"skip-links\"&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"#main\" ref=\"skipLink\" class=\"skip-link\"&gt;Skip to main content&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>\n<p>To hide the link unless it is focused, you can add the following style:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"css\">.skip-links {\n  list-style: none;\n}\n.skip-link {\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  margin: 1em auto;\n  top: 0;\n  position: fixed;\n  left: 50%;\n  margin-left: -72px;\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n.skip-link:focus {\n  opacity: 1;\n  background-color: white;\n  padding: 0.5em;\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}</pre>\n<p>Once a user changes route, bring focus back to the very beginning of the page, right before the skip link.

However, there are many other ways of using animations on the web, even in a Vue application. Here we will discuss a few additional techniques.</p>\n<h2 id=\"class-based-animations\" tabindex=\"-1\">Class-based Animations </h2>\n<p>For elements that are not entering / leaving the DOM, we can trigger animations by dynamically adding a CSS class:</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">const disabled = ref(false)\n\nfunction warnDisabled() {\n  disabled.value = true\n  setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n    disabled.value = false\n  }, 1500)\n}</pre></div>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      disabled: false\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n    warnDisabled() {\n      this.disabled = true\n      setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n        this.disabled = false\n      }, 1500)\n    }\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div :class=\"{ shake: disabled }\"&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"warnDisabled\"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;span v-if=\"disabled\"&gt;This feature is disabled!&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"css\">.shake {\n  animation: shake 0.82s cubic-bezier(0.36, 0.07, 0.19, 0.97) both;\n  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n}\n\n@keyframes shake {\n  10%,\n  90% {\n    transform: translate3d(-1px, 0, 0);\n  }\n\n  20%,\n  80% {\n    transform: translate3d(2px, 0, 0);\n  }\n\n  30%,\n  50%,\n  70% {\n    transform: translate3d(-4px, 0, 0);\n  }\n\n  40%,\n  60% {\n    transform: translate3d(4px, 0, 0);\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"state-driven-animations\" tabindex=\"-1\">State-driven Animations </h2>\n<p>Some transition effects can be applied by interpolating values, for instance by binding a style to an element while an interaction occurs.

They are also unwrapped in the same way when accessed on <code>this</code>.</p>\n<p><code>setup()</code> itself does not have access to the component instance - <code>this</code> will have a value of <code>undefined</code> inside <code>setup()</code>. You can access Composition-API-exposed values from Options API, but not the other way around.</p>\n<p><code>setup()</code> should return an object <em>synchronously</em>. The only case when <code>async setup()</code> can be used is when the component is a descendant of a <a href=\"../guide/built-ins/suspense\">Suspense</a> component.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessing-props\" tabindex=\"-1\">Accessing Props </h2>\n<p>The first argument in the <code>setup</code> function is the <code>props</code> argument. Just as you would expect in a standard component, <code>props</code> inside of a <code>setup</code> function are reactive and will be updated when new props are passed in.</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  props: {\n    title: String\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    console.log(props.title)\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Note that if you destructure the <code>props</code> object, the destructured variables will lose reactivity. It is therefore recommended to always access props in the form of <code>props.xxx</code>.</p>\n<p>If you really need to destructure the props, or need to pass a prop into an external function while retaining reactivity, you can do so with the <a href=\"reactivity-utilities#torefs\">toRefs()</a> and <a href=\"reactivity-utilities#toref\">toRef()</a> utility APIs:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { toRefs, toRef } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup(props) {\n    // turn `props` into an object of refs, then destructure\n    const { title } = toRefs(props)\n    // `title` is a ref that tracks `props.title`\n    console.log(title.value)\n\n    // OR, turn a single property on `props` into a ref\n    const title = toRef(props, 'title')\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"setup-context\" tabindex=\"-1\">Setup Context </h2>\n<p>The second argument passed to the <code>setup</code> function is a <strong>Setup Context</strong> object.

This means you should avoid destructuring them and always reference properties as <code>attrs.x</code> or <code>slots.x</code>. Also note that, unlike <code>props</code>, the properties of <code>attrs</code> and <code>slots</code> are <strong>not</strong> reactive. If you intend to apply side effects based on changes to <code>attrs</code> or <code>slots</code>, you should do so inside an <code>onBeforeUpdate</code> lifecycle hook.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exposing-public-properties\" tabindex=\"-1\">Exposing Public Properties </h3>\n<p><code>expose</code> is a function that can be used to explicitly limit the properties exposed when the component instance is accessed by a parent component via <a href=\"../guide/essentials/template-refs#ref-on-component\">template refs</a>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  setup(props, { expose }) {\n    // make the instance \"closed\" -\n    // i.e. do not expose anything to the parent\n    expose()\n\n    const publicCount = ref(0)\n    const privateCount = ref(0)\n    // selectively expose local state\n    expose({ count: publicCount })\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"usage-with-render-functions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Usage with Render Functions </h2>\n<p><code>setup</code> can also return a <a href=\"../guide/extras/render-function\">render function</a> which can directly make use of the reactive state declared in the same scope:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { h, ref } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    const count = ref(0)\n    return () =&gt; h('div', count.value)\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Returning a render function prevents us from returning anything else.

Component state consists of reactive JavaScript objects. When you modify them, the view updates. It makes state management simple and intuitive, but it’s also important to understand how it works to avoid some common gotchas. In this section, we are going to dig into some of the lower-level details of Vue’s reactivity system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-reactivity\" tabindex=\"-1\">What is Reactivity? </h2>\n<p>This term comes up in programming quite a bit these days, but what do people mean when they say it? Reactivity is a programming paradigm that allows us to adjust to changes in a declarative manner. The canonical example that people usually show, because it’s a great one, is an Excel spreadsheet:</p>\n<table data-v-dffbe810>\n<thead data-v-dffbe810><tr data-v-dffbe810>\n<th data-v-dffbe810></th>\n<th data-v-dffbe810>A</th>\n<th data-v-dffbe810>B</th>\n<th data-v-dffbe810>C</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody data-v-dffbe810>\n<tr data-v-dffbe810>\n<th data-v-dffbe810>0</th>\n<td data-v-dffbe810><div class=\"cell\" title=\"1\" data-v-dffbe810 data-v-3da8ea48><span data-v-3da8ea48>1</span></div></td>\n<td data-v-dffbe810></td>\n<td data-v-dffbe810></td>\n</tr>\n<tr data-v-dffbe810>\n<th data-v-dffbe810>1</th>\n<td data-v-dffbe810><div class=\"cell\" title=\"2\" data-v-dffbe810 data-v-3da8ea48><span data-v-3da8ea48>2</span></div></td>\n<td data-v-dffbe810></td>\n<td data-v-dffbe810></td>\n</tr>\n<tr data-v-dffbe810>\n<th data-v-dffbe810>2</th>\n<td data-v-dffbe810><div class=\"cell\" title=\"= A0 + A1\" data-v-dffbe810 data-v-3da8ea48><span data-v-3da8ea48>3</span></div></td>\n<td data-v-dffbe810></td>\n<td data-v-dffbe810></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here cell A2 is defined via a formula of <code>= A0 + A1</code> (you can click on A2 to view or edit the formula), so the spreadsheet gives us 3. No surprises there. But if you update A0 or A1, you'll notice that A2 automagically updates too.</p>\n<p>JavaScript doesn’t usually work like this. If we were to write something comparable in JavaScript:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">let A0 = 1\nlet A1 = 2\nlet A2 = A0 + A1\n\nconsole.log(A2) // 3\n\nA0 = 2\nconsole.log(A2) // Still 3</pre>\n<p>When we mutate <code>A0</code>, <code>A2</code> does not change automatically.</p>\n<p>So how would we do this in JavaScript? First, in order to re-run the code that updates <code>A2</code>, let's wrap it in a function:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">let A2\n\nfunction update() {\n  A2 = A0 + A1\n}</pre>\n<p>Then, we need to define a few terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <code>update()</code> function produces a <strong>side effect</strong>, or <strong>effect</strong> for short, because it modifies the state of the program.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>A0</code> and <code>A1</code> are considered <strong>dependencies</strong> of the effect, as their values are used to perform the effect. The effect is said to be a <strong>subscriber</strong> to its dependencies.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What we need is a magic function that can invoke <code>update()</code> (the <strong>effect</strong>) whenever <code>A0</code> or <code>A1</code> (the <strong>dependencies</strong>) change:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">whenDepsChange(update)</pre>\n<p>This <code>whenDepsChange()</code> function has the following tasks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Track when a variable is read. E.g. when evaluating the expression <code>A0 + A1</code>, both <code>A0</code> and <code>A1</code> are read.</p></li>\n<li><p>If a variable is read when there is a currently running effect, make that effect a subscriber to that variable. E.g. because <code>A0</code> and <code>A1</code> are read when <code>update()</code> is being executed, <code>update()</code> becomes a subscriber to both <code>A0</code> and <code>A1</code> after the first call.</p></li>\n<li><p>Detect when a variable is mutated. E.g. when <code>A0</code> is assigned a new value, notify all its subscriber effects to re-run.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"how-reactivity-works-in-vue\" tabindex=\"-1\">How Reactivity Works in Vue </h2>\n<p>We can't really track the reading and writing of local variables like in the example. There's just no mechanism for doing that in vanilla JavaScript. What we <strong>can</strong> do though, is intercept the reading and writing of <strong>object properties</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are two ways of intercepting property access in JavaScript: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get#description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">getter</a> / <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set#description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">setters</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Proxies</a>. Vue 2 used getter / setters exclusively due to browser support limitations. In Vue 3, Proxies are used for reactive objects and getter / setters are used for refs. Here's some pseudo-code that illustrates how they work:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function reactive(obj) {\n  return new Proxy(obj, {\n    get(target, key) {\n      track(target, key)\n      return target[key]\n    },\n    set(target, key, value) {\n      target[key] = value\n      trigger(target, key)\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nfunction ref(value) {\n  const refObject = {\n    get value() {\n      track(refObject, 'value')\n      return value\n    },\n    set value(newValue) {\n      value = newValue\n      trigger(refObject, 'value')\n    }\n  }\n  return refObject\n}</pre>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Code snippets here and below are meant to explain the core concepts in the simplest form possible, so many details are omitted, and edge cases ignored.</p>\n</div>\n<p>This explains a few <a href=\"../essentials/reactivity-fundamentals#limitations-of-reactive\">limitations of reactive objects</a> that we have discussed in the fundamentals section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>When you assign or destructure a reactive object's property to a local variable, accessing or assigning to that variable is non-reactive because it no longer triggers the get / set proxy traps on the source object. Note this \"disconnect\" only affects the variable binding - if the variable points to a non-primitive value such as an object, mutating the object would still be reactive.</p></li>\n<li><p>The returned proxy from <code>reactive()</code>, although behaving just like the original, has a different identity if we compare it to the original using the <code>===</code> operator.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inside <code>track()</code>, we check whether there is a currently running effect. If there is one, we lookup the subscriber effects (stored in a Set) for the property being tracked, and add the effect to the Set:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// This will be set right before an effect is about\n// to be run. We'll deal with this later.\nlet activeEffect\n\nfunction track(target, key) {\n  if (activeEffect) {\n    const effects = getSubscribersForProperty(target, key)\n    effects.add(activeEffect)\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Effect subscriptions are stored in a global <code>WeakMap&lt;target, Map&lt;key, Set&lt;effect&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> data structure. If no subscribing effects Set was found for a property (tracked for the first time), it will be created. This is what the <code>getSubscribersForProperty()</code> function does, in short. For simplicity, we will skip its details.</p>\n<p>Inside <code>trigger()</code>, we again lookup the subscriber effects for the property. But this time we invoke them instead:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function trigger(target, key) {\n  const effects = getSubscribersForProperty(target, key)\n  effects.forEach((effect) =&gt; effect())\n}</pre>\n<p>Now let's circle back to the <code>whenDepsChange()</code> function:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function whenDepsChange(update) {\n  const effect = () =&gt; {\n    activeEffect = effect\n    update()\n    activeEffect = null\n  }\n  effect()\n}</pre>\n<p>It wraps the raw <code>update</code> function in an effect that sets itself as the current active effect before running the actual update. This enables <code>track()</code> calls during the update to locate the current active effect.</p>\n<p>At this point, we have created an effect that automatically tracks its dependencies, and re-runs whenever a dependency changes. We call this a <strong>Reactive Effect</strong>.</p>\n<p>Vue provides an API that allows you to create reactive effects: <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-core#watcheffect\"><code>watchEffect()</code></a>. In fact, you may have noticed that it works pretty similarly to the magical <code>whenDepsChange()</code> in the example. We can now rework the original example using actual Vue APIs:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref, watchEffect } from 'vue'\n\nconst A0 = ref(0)\nconst A1 = ref(1)\nconst A2 = ref()\n\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; {\n  // tracks A0 and A1\n  A2.value = A0.value + A1.value\n})\n\n// triggers the effect\nA0.value = 2</pre>\n<p>Using a reactive effect to mutate a ref isn't the most interesting use case - in fact, using a computed property makes it more declarative:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref, computed } from 'vue'\n\nconst A0 = ref(0)\nconst A1 = ref(1)\nconst A2 = computed(() =&gt; A0.value + A1.value)\n\nA0.value = 2</pre>\n<p>Internally, <code>computed</code> manages its invalidation and re-computation using a reactive effect.</p>\n<p>So what's an example of a common and useful reactive effect? Well, updating the DOM! We can implement simple \"reactive rendering\" like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref, watchEffect } from 'vue'\n\nconst count = ref(0)\n\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; {\n  document.body.innerHTML = `Count is: ${count.value}`\n})\n\n// updates the DOM\ncount.value++</pre>\n<p>In fact, this is pretty close to how a Vue component keeps the state and the DOM in sync - each component instance creates a reactive effect to render and update the DOM. Of course, Vue components use much more efficient ways to update the DOM than <code>innerHTML</code>. This is discussed in <a href=\"rendering-mechanism\">Rendering Mechanism</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"options-api\"><p>The <code>ref()</code>, <code>computed()</code> and <code>watchEffect()</code> APIs are all part of the Composition API. If you have only been using Options API with Vue so far, you'll notice that Composition API is closer to how Vue's reactivity system works under the hood. In fact, in Vue 3 the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API. All property access on the component instance (<code>this</code>) triggers getter / setters for reactivity tracking, and options like <code>watch</code> and <code>computed</code> invoke their Composition API equivalents internally.</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"runtime-vs-compile-time-reactivity\" tabindex=\"-1\">Runtime vs. Compile-time Reactivity </h2>\n<p>Vue's reactivity system is primarily runtime-based: the tracking and triggering are all performed while the code is running directly in the browser. The pros of runtime reactivity are that it can work without a build step, and there are fewer edge cases. On the other hand, this makes it constrained by the syntax limitations of JavaScript, leading to the need of value containers like Vue refs.</p>\n<p>Some frameworks, such as <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Svelte</a>, choose to overcome such limitations by implementing reactivity during compilation. It analyzes and transforms the code in order to simulate reactivity. The compilation step allows the framework to alter the semantics of JavaScript itself - for example, implicitly injecting code that performs dependency analysis and effect triggering around access to locally defined variables. The downside is that such transforms require a build step, and altering JavaScript semantics is essentially creating a language that looks like JavaScript but compiles into something else.</p>\n<p>The Vue team did explore this direction via an experimental feature called <a href=\"reactivity-transform\">Reactivity Transform</a>, but in the end we have decided that it would not be a good fit for the project due to <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/369#discussioncomment-5059028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the reasoning here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reactivity-debugging\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reactivity Debugging </h2>\n<p>It's great that Vue's reactivity system automatically tracks dependencies, but in some cases we may want to figure out exactly what is being tracked, or what is causing a component to re-render.</p>\n<h3 id=\"component-debugging-hooks\" tabindex=\"-1\">Component Debugging Hooks </h3>\n<p>We can debug what dependencies are used during a component's render and which dependency is triggering an update using the <span class=\"options-api\"><code>renderTracked</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onRenderTracked</code></span> and <span class=\"options-api\"><code>renderTriggered</code></span><span class=\"composition-api\"><code>onRenderTriggered</code></span> lifecycle hooks.

The deep conversion can be unnecessary or sometimes unwanted when integrating with external state management systems (e.g. if an external solution also uses Proxies).</p>\n<p>The general idea of integrating Vue's reactivity system with an external state management solution is to hold the external state in a <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref\"><code>shallowRef</code></a>. A shallow ref is only reactive when its <code>.value</code> property is accessed - the inner value is left intact. When the external state changes, replace the ref value to trigger updates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"immutable-data\" tabindex=\"-1\">Immutable Data </h3>\n<p>If you are implementing an undo / redo feature, you likely want to take a snapshot of the application's state on every user edit. However, Vue's mutable reactivity system isn't best suited for this if the state tree is large, because serializing the entire state object on every update can be expensive in terms of both CPU and memory costs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Immutable data structures</a> solve this by never mutating the state objects - instead, it creates new objects that share the same, unchanged parts with old ones. There are different ways of using immutable data in JavaScript, but we recommend using <a href=\"https://immerjs.github.io/immer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Immer</a> with Vue because it allows you to use immutable data while keeping the more ergonomic, mutable syntax.</p>\n<p>We can integrate Immer with Vue via a simple composable:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { produce } from 'immer'\nimport { shallowRef } from 'vue'\n\nexport function useImmer(baseState) {\n  const state = shallowRef(baseState)\n  const update = (updater) =&gt; {\n    state.value = produce(state.value, updater)\n  }\n\n  return [state, update]\n}</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#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\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"state-machines\" tabindex=\"-1\">State Machines </h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">State Machine</a> is a model for describing all the possible states an application can be in, and all the possible ways it can transition from one state to another.

It's a value container that provides dependency tracking on access, and side-effect triggering on mutation. This reactivity-primitive-based paradigm isn't a particularly new concept in the frontend world: it dates back to implementations like <a href=\"https://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Knockout observables</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.meteor.com/api/tracker.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meteor Tracker</a> from more than a decade ago. Vue Options API and the React state management library <a href=\"https://mobx.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MobX</a> are also based on the same principles, but hide the primitives behind object properties.</p>\n<p>Although not a necessary trait for something to qualify as signals, today the concept is often discussed alongside the rendering model where updates are performed through fine-grained subscriptions. Due to the use of Virtual DOM, Vue currently <a href=\"rendering-mechanism#compiler-informed-virtual-dom\">relies on compilers to achieve similar optimizations</a>. However, we are also exploring a new Solid-inspired compilation strategy, called <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/core-vapor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vapor Mode</a>, that does not rely on Virtual DOM and takes more advantage of Vue's built-in reactivity system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"api-design-trade-offs\" tabindex=\"-1\">API Design Trade-Offs </h3>\n<p>The design of Preact and Qwik's signals are very similar to Vue's <a href=\"../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref\">shallowRef</a>: all three provide a mutable interface via the <code>.value</code> property. We will focus the discussion on Solid and Angular signals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"solid-signals\" tabindex=\"-1\">Solid Signals </h4>\n<p>Solid's <code>createSignal()</code> API design emphasizes read / write segregation.

This ensures that the state can never be mutated unless the setter is also explicitly exposed. Whether this safety guarantee justifies the more verbose syntax could be subject to the requirement of the project and personal taste - but in case you prefer this API style, you can easily replicate it in Vue:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { shallowRef, triggerRef } from 'vue'\n\nexport function createSignal(value, options) {\n  const r = shallowRef(value)\n  const get = () =&gt; r.value\n  const set = (v) =&gt; {\n    r.value = typeof v === 'function' ? v(r.value) : v\n    if (options?.equals === false) triggerRef(r)\n  }\n  return [get, set]\n}</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpdUk1TgzAQ/Ss7uQAjgr12oNXxH+ix9IAYaDQkMV/qMPx3N6G0Uy9Msu/tvn2PTORJqcI7SrakMp1myoKh1qldI9iopLYwQadpa+krG0TLYYZeyxGSojSSs/d7E8vFh0ka0YhOCmPh0EknbB4mPYfTEeqbIelD1oiqXPRQCS+WjoojAW8A1Wmzm1A39KYZzHNVYiUib85aKeCx46z7rBuySqQe6h14uINN1pDIBWACVUcqbGwtl17EqvIiR3LyzwcmcXFuTi3n8vuF9jlYzYaBajxfMsDcomv6E/m9E51luN2NV99yR3OQKkAmgykss+SkMZerxMLEZFZ4oBYJGAA600VEryAaD6CPaJwJKwnr9ldR2WMedV1Dsi6WwB58emZlsAV/zqmH9LzfvqBfruUmNvZ4QN7VearjenP4aHwmWsABt4x/+tiImcx/z27Jqw==\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Try it in the Playground</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"angular-signals\" tabindex=\"-1\">Angular Signals </h4>\n<p>Angular is undergoing some fundamental changes by foregoing dirty-checking and introducing its own implementation of a reactivity primitive.

Consuming custom elements inside a Vue application largely works the same as using native HTML elements, with a few things to keep in mind:</p>\n<h3 id=\"skipping-component-resolution\" tabindex=\"-1\">Skipping Component Resolution </h3>\n<p>By default, Vue will attempt to resolve a non-native HTML tag as a registered Vue component before falling back to rendering it as a custom element. This will cause Vue to emit a \"failed to resolve component\" warning during development. To let Vue know that certain elements should be treated as custom elements and skip component resolution, we can specify the <a href=\"../../api/application#app-config-compileroptions\"><code>compilerOptions.isCustomElement</code> option</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are using Vue with a build setup, the option should be passed via build configs since it is a compile-time option.</p>\n<h4 id=\"example-in-browser-config\" tabindex=\"-1\">Example In-Browser Config </h4>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// Only works if using in-browser compilation.\n// If using build tools, see config examples below.\napp.config.compilerOptions.isCustomElement = (tag) =&gt; tag.includes('-')</pre>\n<h4 id=\"example-vite-config\" tabindex=\"-1\">Example Vite Config </h4>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"vite.config.js\">vite.config.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'\n\nexport default {\n  plugins: [\n    vue({\n      template: {\n        compilerOptions: {\n          // treat all tags with a dash as custom elements\n          isCustomElement: (tag) =&gt; tag.includes('-')\n        }\n      }\n    })\n  ]\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"example-vue-cli-config\" tabindex=\"-1\">Example Vue CLI Config </h4>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"vue.config.js\">vue.config.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">module.exports = {\n  chainWebpack: (config) =&gt; {\n    config.module\n      .rule('vue')\n      .use('vue-loader')\n      .tap((options) =&gt; ({\n        ...options,\n        compilerOptions: {\n          // treat any tag that starts with ion- as custom elements\n          isCustomElement: (tag) =&gt; tag.startsWith('ion-')\n        }\n      }))\n  }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"passing-dom-properties\" tabindex=\"-1\">Passing DOM Properties </h3>\n<p>Since DOM attributes can only be strings, we need to pass complex data to custom elements as DOM properties. When setting props on a custom element, Vue 3 automatically checks DOM-property presence using the <code>in</code> operator and will prefer setting the value as a DOM property if the key is present. This means that, in most cases, you won't need to think about this if the custom element follows the <a href=\"https://web.dev/custom-elements-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">recommended best practices</a>.</p>\n<p>However, there could be rare cases where the data must be passed as a DOM property, but the custom element does not properly define/reflect the property (causing the <code>in</code> check to fail). In this case, you can force a <code>v-bind</code> binding to be set as a DOM property using the <code>.prop</code> modifier:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;my-element :user.prop=\"{ name: 'jack' }\"&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- shorthand equivalent --&gt;\n&lt;my-element .user=\"{ name: 'jack' }\"&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;</pre>\n<h2 id=\"building-custom-elements-with-vue\" tabindex=\"-1\">Building Custom Elements with Vue </h2>\n<p>The primary benefit of custom elements is that they can be used with any framework, or even without a framework.

When using an SFC as a custom element, it is often desirable to inject the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags into the custom element's shadow root instead.</p>\n<p>The official SFC toolings support importing SFCs in \"custom element mode\" (requires <code>@vitejs/plugin-vue@^1.4.0</code> or <code>vue-loader@^16.5.0</code>). An SFC loaded in custom element mode inlines its <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags as strings of CSS and exposes them under the component's <code>styles</code> option.

There is a ~16kb baseline size cost depending on how many features are being used. This means it is not ideal to use Vue if you are shipping a single custom element - you may want to use vanilla JavaScript, <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">petite-vue</a>, or frameworks that specialize in small runtime size. However, the base size is more than justifiable if you are shipping a collection of custom elements with complex logic, as Vue will allow each component to be authored with much less code. The more elements you are shipping together, the better the trade-off.</p>\n<p>If the custom elements will be used in an application that is also using Vue, you can choose to externalize Vue from the built bundle so that the elements will be using the same copy of Vue from the host application.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to export the individual element constructors to give your users the flexibility to import them on-demand and register them with desired tag names. You can also export a convenience function to automatically register all elements. Here's an example entry point of a Vue custom element library:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"elements.js\">elements.js</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { defineCustomElement } from 'vue'\nimport Foo from './MyFoo.ce.vue'\nimport Bar from './MyBar.ce.vue'\n\nconst MyFoo = defineCustomElement(Foo)\nconst MyBar = defineCustomElement(Bar)\n\n// export individual elements\nexport { MyFoo, MyBar }\n\nexport function register() {\n  customElements.define('my-foo', MyFoo)\n  customElements.define('my-bar', MyBar)\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>A consumer can use the elements in a Vue file:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport { register } from 'path/to/elements.js'\nregister()\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;my-foo ...&gt;\n    &lt;my-bar ...&gt;&lt;/my-bar&gt;\n  &lt;/my-foo&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>Or in any other framework such as one with JSX, and with custom names:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"jsx\">import { MyFoo, MyBar } from 'path/to/elements.js'\n\ncustomElements.define('some-foo', MyFoo)\ncustomElements.define('some-bar', MyBar)\n\nexport function MyComponent() {\n  return &lt;&gt;\n    &lt;some-foo ... &gt;\n      &lt;some-bar ... &gt;&lt;/some-bar&gt;\n    &lt;/some-foo&gt;\n  &lt;/&gt;\n}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"web-components-and-typescript\" tabindex=\"-1\">Vue-based Web Components and TypeScript </h3>\n<p>When writing Vue SFC templates, you may want to <a href=\"../scaling-up/tooling#typescript\">type check</a> your Vue components, including those that are defined as custom elements.</p>\n<p>Custom elements are registered globally in browsers using their built-in APIs, and by default they won't have type inference when used in Vue templates. To provide type support for Vue components registered as custom elements, we can register global component typings by augmenting the <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/wiki/Global-Component-Types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>GlobalComponents</code> interface</a> for type checking in Vue templates (JSX users can augment the <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#intrinsic-elements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JSX.IntrinsicElements</a> type instead, which is not shown here).</p>\n<p>Here is how to define the type for a custom element made with Vue:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"typescript\">import { defineCustomElement } from 'vue'\n\n// Import the Vue component.\nimport SomeComponent from './src/components/SomeComponent.ce.vue'\n\n// Turn the Vue component into a Custom Element class.\nexport const SomeElement = defineCustomElement(SomeComponent)\n\n// Remember to register the element class with the browser.\ncustomElements.define('some-element', SomeElement)\n\n// Add the new element type to Vue's GlobalComponents type.\ndeclare module 'vue' {\n  interface GlobalComponents {\n    // Be sure to pass in the Vue component type here \n    // (SomeComponent, *not* SomeElement).\n    // Custom Elements require a hyphen in their name, \n    // so use the hyphenated element name here.\n    'some-element': typeof SomeComponent\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"non-vue-web-components-and-typescript\" tabindex=\"-1\">Non-Vue Web Components and TypeScript </h2>\n<p>Here is the recommended way to enable type checking in SFC templates of Custom Elements that are not built with Vue.</p>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Note</strong><p>This approach is one possible way to do it, but it may vary depending on the framework being used to create the custom elements.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Suppose we have a custom element with some JS properties and events defined, and it is shipped in a library called <code>some-lib</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title\">\n<div class=\"vp-code-block-title-bar\"><span class=\"vp-code-block-title-text\" data-title=\"some-lib/src/SomeElement.ts\">some-lib/src/SomeElement.ts</span></div>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">// Define a class with typed JS properties.\nexport class SomeElement extends HTMLElement {\n  foo: number = 123\n  bar: string = 'blah'\n\n  lorem: boolean = false\n\n  // This method should not be exposed to template types.\n  someMethod() {\n    /* ... */\n  }\n\n  // ... implementation details omitted ...\n  // ... assume the element dispatches events named \"apple-fell\" ...\n}\n\ncustomElements.define('some-element', SomeElement)\n\n// This is a list of properties of SomeElement that will be selected for type\n// checking in framework templates (f.e.

Users should import the framework-specific type definition file that they need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"web-components-vs-vue-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Web Components vs. Vue Components </h2>\n<p>Some developers believe that framework-proprietary component models should be avoided, and that exclusively using Custom Elements makes an application \"future-proof\". Here we will try to explain why we believe that this is an overly simplistic take on the problem.</p>\n<p>There is indeed a certain level of feature overlap between Custom Elements and Vue Components: they both allow us to define reusable components with data passing, event emitting, and lifecycle management. However, Web Components APIs are relatively low-level and bare-bones. To build an actual application, we need quite a few additional capabilities which the platform does not cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A declarative and efficient templating system;</p></li>\n<li><p>A reactive state management system that facilitates cross-component logic extraction and reuse;</p></li>\n<li><p>A performant way to render the components on the server and hydrate them on the client (SSR), which is important for SEO and <a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Web Vitals metrics such as LCP</a>. Native custom elements SSR typically involves simulating the DOM in Node.js and then serializing the mutated DOM, while Vue SSR compiles into string concatenation whenever possible, which is much more efficient.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vue's component model is designed with these needs in mind as a coherent system.</p>\n<p>With a competent engineering team, you could probably build the equivalent on top of native Custom Elements - but this also means you are taking on the long-term maintenance burden of an in-house framework, while losing out on the ecosystem and community benefits of a mature framework like Vue.</p>\n<p>There are also frameworks built using Custom Elements as the basis of their component model, but they all inevitably have to introduce their proprietary solutions to the problems listed above. Using these frameworks entails buying into their technical decisions on how to solve these problems - which, despite what may be advertised, doesn't automatically insulate you from potential future churns.</p>\n<p>There are also some areas where we find custom elements to be limiting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Eager slot evaluation hinders component composition. Vue's <a href=\"../components/slots#scoped-slots\">scoped slots</a> are a powerful mechanism for component composition, which can't be supported by custom elements due to native slots' eager nature. Eager slots also mean the receiving component cannot control when or whether to render a piece of slot content.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shipping custom elements with shadow DOM scoped CSS today requires embedding the CSS inside JavaScript so that they can be injected into shadow roots at runtime. They also result in duplicated styles in markup in SSR scenarios. There are <a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/4898/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">platform features</a> being worked on in this area - but as of now they are not yet universally supported, and there are still production performance / SSR concerns to be addressed. In the meanwhile, Vue SFCs provide <a href=\"../../api/sfc-css-features\">CSS scoping mechanisms</a> that support extracting the styles into plain CSS files.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vue will always stay up to date with the latest standards in the web platform, and we will happily leverage whatever the platform provides if it makes our job easier.

This name is inherited from conventions shared by many virtual DOM implementations. A more descriptive name could be <code>createVNode()</code>, but a shorter name helps when you have to call this function many times in a render function.</p>\n<p>The <code>h()</code> function is designed to be very flexible:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// all arguments except the type are optional\nh('div')\nh('div', { id: 'foo' })\n\n// both attributes and properties can be used in props\n// Vue automatically picks the right way to assign it\nh('div', { class: 'bar', innerHTML: 'hello' })\n\n// props modifiers such as `.prop` and `.attr` can be added\n// with `.` and `^` prefixes respectively\nh('div', { '.name': 'some-name', '^width': '100' })\n\n// class and style have the same object / array\n// value support that they have in templates\nh('div', { class: [foo, { bar }], style: { color: 'red' } })\n\n// event listeners should be passed as onXxx\nh('div', { onClick: () =&gt; {} })\n\n// children can be a string\nh('div', { id: 'foo' }, 'hello')\n\n// props can be omitted when there are no props\nh('div', 'hello')\nh('div', [h('span', 'hello')])\n\n// children array can contain mixed vnodes and strings\nh('div', ['hello', h('span', 'hello')])</pre>\n<p>The resulting vnode has the following shape:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const vnode = h('div', { id: 'foo' }, [])\n\nvnode.type // 'div'\nvnode.props // { id: 'foo' }\nvnode.children // []\nvnode.key // null</pre>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Note</strong><p>The full <code>VNode</code> interface contains many other internal properties, but it is strongly recommended to avoid relying on any properties other than the ones listed here. This avoids unintended breakage in case the internal properties are changed.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"declaring-render-functions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Declaring Render Functions </h3>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>When using templates with Composition API, the return value of the <code>setup()</code> hook is used to expose data to the template. When using render functions, however, we can directly return the render function instead:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref, h } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  props: {\n    /* ... */\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    const count = ref(1)\n\n    // return the render function\n    return () =&gt; h('div', props.msg + count.value)\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>The render function is declared inside <code>setup()</code> so it naturally has access to the props and any reactive state declared in the same scope.</p>\n<p>In addition to returning a single vnode, you can also return strings or arrays:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  setup() {\n    return () =&gt; 'hello world!'\n  }\n}</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { h } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  setup() {\n    // use an array to return multiple root nodes\n    return () =&gt; [\n      h('div'),\n      h('div'),\n      h('div')\n    ]\n  }\n}</pre>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">TIP</strong><p>Make sure to return a function instead of directly returning values! The <code>setup()</code> function is called only once per component, while the returned render function will be called multiple times.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<p>We can declare render functions using the <code>render</code> option:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { h } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      msg: 'hello'\n    }\n  },\n  render() {\n    return h('div', this.msg)\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>The <code>render()</code> function has access to the component instance via <code>this</code>.</p>\n<p>In addition to returning a single vnode, you can also return strings or arrays:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  render() {\n    return 'hello world!'\n  }\n}</pre>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { h } from 'vue'\n\nexport default {\n  render() {\n    // use an array to return multiple root nodes\n    return [\n      h('div'),\n      h('div'),\n      h('div')\n    ]\n  }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>If a render function component doesn't need any instance state, they can also be declared directly as a function for brevity:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function Hello() {\n  return 'hello world!'\n}</pre>\n<p>That's right, this is a valid Vue component! See <a href=\"#functional-components\">Functional Components</a> for more details on this syntax.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vnodes-must-be-unique\" tabindex=\"-1\">Vnodes Must Be Unique </h3>\n<p>All vnodes in the component tree must be unique.

For example, the following render function is a perfectly valid way of rendering 20 identical paragraphs:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function render() {\n  return h(\n    'div',\n    Array.from({ length: 20 }).map(() =&gt; {\n      return h('p', 'hi')\n    })\n  )\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"jsx-tsx\" tabindex=\"-1\">JSX / TSX </h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/jsx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JSX</a> is an XML-like extension to JavaScript that allows us to write code like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"jsx\">const vnode = &lt;div&gt;hello&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>Inside JSX expressions, use curly braces to embed dynamic values:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"jsx\">const vnode = &lt;div id={dynamicId}&gt;hello, {userName}&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p><code>create-vue</code> and Vue CLI both have options for scaffolding projects with pre-configured JSX support. If you are configuring JSX manually, please refer to the documentation of <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/jsx-next\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>@vue/babel-plugin-jsx</code></a> for details.</p>\n<p>Although first introduced by React, JSX actually has no defined runtime semantics and can be compiled into various different outputs. If you have worked with JSX before, do note that <strong>Vue JSX transform is different from React's JSX transform</strong>, so you can't use React's JSX transform in Vue applications. Some notable differences from React JSX include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use HTML attributes such as <code>class</code> and <code>for</code> as props - no need to use <code>className</code> or <code>htmlFor</code>.</li>\n<li>Passing children to components (i.e. slots) <a href=\"#passing-slots\">works differently</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vue's type definition also provides type inference for TSX usage. When using TSX, make sure to specify <code>\"jsx\": \"preserve\"</code> in <code>tsconfig.json</code> so that TypeScript leaves the JSX syntax intact for Vue JSX transform to process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jsx-type-inference\" tabindex=\"-1\">JSX Type Inference </h3>\n<p>Similar to the transform, Vue's JSX also needs different type definitions.</p>\n<p>Starting in Vue 3.4, Vue no longer implicitly registers the global <code>JSX</code> namespace.

They act like pure functions: props in, vnodes out. They are rendered without creating a component instance (i.e. no <code>this</code>), and without the usual component lifecycle hooks.</p>\n<p>To create a functional component we use a plain function, rather than an options object. The function is effectively the <code>render</code> function for the component.</p>\n<div class=\"composition-api\">\n<p>The signature of a functional component is the same as the <code>setup()</code> hook:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function MyComponent(props, { slots, emit, attrs }) {\n  // ...\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"options-api\">\n<p>As there is no <code>this</code> reference for a functional component, Vue will pass in the <code>props</code> as the first argument:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function MyComponent(props, context) {\n  // ...\n}</pre>\n<p>The second argument, <code>context</code>, contains three properties: <code>attrs</code>, <code>emit</code>, and <code>slots</code>. These are equivalent to the instance properties <a href=\"../../api/component-instance#attrs\"><code>$attrs</code></a>, <a href=\"../../api/component-instance#emit\"><code>$emit</code></a>, and <a href=\"../../api/component-instance#slots\"><code>$slots</code></a> respectively.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Most of the usual configuration options for components are not available for functional components. However, it is possible to define <a href=\"../../api/options-state#props\"><code>props</code></a> and <a href=\"../../api/options-state#emits\"><code>emits</code></a> by adding them as properties:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">MyComponent.props = ['value']\nMyComponent.emits = ['click']</pre>\n<p>If the <code>props</code> option is not specified, then the <code>props</code> object passed to the function will contain all attributes, the same as <code>attrs</code>. The prop names will not be normalized to camelCase unless the <code>props</code> option is specified.</p>\n<p>For functional components with explicit <code>props</code>, <a href=\"../components/attrs\">attribute fallthrough</a> works much the same as with normal components. However, for functional components that don't explicitly specify their <code>props</code>, only the <code>class</code>, <code>style</code>, and <code>onXxx</code> event listeners will be inherited from the <code>attrs</code> by default. In either case, <code>inheritAttrs</code> can be set to <code>false</code> to disable attribute inheritance:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">MyComponent.inheritAttrs = false</pre>\n<p>Functional components can be registered and consumed just like normal components.

It is the recommended syntax if you are using both SFCs and Composition API. It provides a number of advantages over the normal <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> syntax:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More succinct code with less boilerplate</li>\n<li>Ability to declare props and emitted events using pure TypeScript</li>\n<li>Better runtime performance (the template is compiled into a render function in the same scope, without an intermediate proxy)</li>\n<li>Better IDE type-inference performance (less work for the language server to extract types from code)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"basic-syntax\" tabindex=\"-1\">Basic Syntax </h2>\n<p>To opt-in to the syntax, add the <code>setup</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nconsole.log('hello script setup')\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>The code inside is compiled as the content of the component's <code>setup()</code> function. This means that unlike normal <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, which only executes once when the component is first imported, code inside <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> will <strong>execute every time an instance of the component is created</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"top-level-bindings-are-exposed-to-template\" tabindex=\"-1\">Top-level bindings are exposed to template </h3>\n<p>When using <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>, any top-level bindings (including variables, function declarations, and imports) declared inside <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> are directly usable in the template:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\n// variable\nconst msg = 'Hello!'\n\n// functions\nfunction log() {\n  console.log(msg)\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"log\"&gt;{{ msg }}&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>Imports are exposed in the same fashion.

If you have used JSX, the mental model is similar here.

It also helps differentiating from native custom elements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-components\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dynamic Components </h3>\n<p>Since components are referenced as variables instead of registered under string keys, we should use dynamic <code>:is</code> binding when using dynamic components inside <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nimport Foo from './Foo.vue'\nimport Bar from './Bar.vue'\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;component :is=\"Foo\" /&gt;\n  &lt;component :is=\"someCondition ?

E.g. a file named <code>FooBar.vue</code> can refer to itself as <code>&lt;FooBar/&gt;</code> in its template.</p>\n<p>Note this has lower priority than imported components.

They do not need to be imported, and are compiled away when <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> is processed.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>defineProps</code> accepts the same value as the <code>props</code> option, while <code>defineEmits</code> accepts the same value as the <code>emits</code> option.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>defineProps</code> and <code>defineEmits</code> provide proper type inference based on the options passed.</p></li>\n<li><p>The options passed to <code>defineProps</code> and <code>defineEmits</code> will be hoisted out of setup into module scope. Therefore, the options cannot reference local variables declared in setup scope. Doing so will result in a compile error. However, it <em>can</em> reference imported bindings since they are in the module scope as well.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"type-only-props-emit-declarations\" tabindex=\"-1\">Type-only props/emit declarations </h3>\n<p>Props and emits can also be declared using pure-type syntax by passing a literal type argument to <code>defineProps</code> or <code>defineEmits</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const props = defineProps&lt;{\n  foo: string\n  bar?: number\n}&gt;()\n\nconst emit = defineEmits&lt;{\n  (e: 'change', id: number): void\n  (e: 'update', value: string): void\n}&gt;()\n\n// 3.3+: alternative, more succinct syntax\nconst emit = defineEmits&lt;{\n  change: [id: number] // named tuple syntax\n  update: [value: string]\n}&gt;()</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>defineProps</code> or <code>defineEmits</code> can only use either runtime declaration OR type declaration. Using both at the same time will result in a compile error.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p>When using type declaration, the equivalent runtime declaration is automatically generated from static analysis to remove the need for double declaration and still ensure correct runtime behavior.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>In dev mode, the compiler will try to infer corresponding runtime validation from the types. For example here <code>foo: String</code> is inferred from the <code>foo: string</code> type. If the type is a reference to an imported type, the inferred result will be <code>foo: null</code> (equal to <code>any</code> type) since the compiler does not have information of external files.</p></li>\n<li><p>In prod mode, the compiler will generate the array format declaration to reduce bundle size (the props here will be compiled into <code>['foo', 'bar']</code>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In version 3.2 and below, the generic type parameter for <code>defineProps()</code> were limited to a type literal or a reference to a local interface.</p>\n<p>This limitation has been resolved in 3.3. The latest version of Vue supports referencing imported and a limited set of complex types in the type parameter position. However, because the type to runtime conversion is still AST-based, some complex types that require actual type analysis, e.g. conditional types, are not supported. You can use conditional types for the type of a single prop, but not the entire props object.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"reactive-props-destructure\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reactive Props Destructure  </h3>\n<p>In Vue 3.5 and above, variables destructured from the return value of <code>defineProps</code> are reactive. Vue's compiler automatically prepends <code>props.</code> when code in the same <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> block accesses variables destructured from <code>defineProps</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const { foo } = defineProps(['foo'])\n\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; {\n  // runs only once before 3.5\n  // re-runs when the \"foo\" prop changes in 3.5+\n  console.log(foo)\n})</pre>\n<p>The above is compiled to the following equivalent:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">const props = defineProps(['foo'])\n\nwatchEffect(() =&gt; {\n  // `foo` transformed to `props.foo` by the compiler\n  console.log(props.foo)\n})</pre>\n<p>In addition, you can use JavaScript's native default value syntax to declare default values for the props. This is particularly useful when using the type-based props declaration:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface Props {\n  msg?: string\n  labels?: string[]\n}\n\nconst { msg = 'hello', labels = ['one', 'two'] } = defineProps&lt;Props&gt;()</pre>\n<h3 id=\"default-props-values-when-using-type-declaration\" tabindex=\"-1\">Default props values when using type declaration  </h3>\n<p>In 3.5 and above, default values can be naturally declared when using Reactive Props Destructure. But in 3.4 and below, Reactive Props Destructure is not enabled by default. In order to declare props default values with type-based declaration, the <code>withDefaults</code> compiler macro is needed:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface Props {\n  msg?: string\n  labels?: string[]\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps&lt;Props&gt;(), {\n  msg: 'hello',\n  labels: () =&gt; ['one', 'two']\n})</pre>\n<p>This will be compiled to equivalent runtime props <code>default</code> options. In addition, the <code>withDefaults</code> helper provides type checks for the default values, and ensures the returned <code>props</code> type has the optional flags removed for properties that do have default values declared.</p>\n<div class=\"info custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">INFO</strong><p>Note that default values for mutable reference types (like arrays or objects) should be wrapped in functions when using <code>withDefaults</code> to avoid accidental modification and external side effects. This ensures each component instance gets its own copy of the default value. This is <strong>not</strong> necessary when using default values with destructure.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"definemodel\" tabindex=\"-1\">defineModel() </h2>\n<ul><li>Only available in 3.4+</li></ul>\n<p>This macro can be used to declare a two-way binding prop that can be consumed via <code>v-model</code> from the parent component. Example usage is also discussed in the <a href=\"../guide/components/v-model\">Component <code>v-model</code></a> guide.</p>\n<p>Under the hood, this macro declares a model prop and a corresponding value update event. If the first argument is a literal string, it will be used as the prop name; Otherwise the prop name will default to <code>\"modelValue\"</code>. In both cases, you can also pass an additional object which can include the prop's options and the model ref's value transform options.</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">// declares \"modelValue\" prop, consumed by parent via v-model\nconst model = defineModel()\n// OR: declares \"modelValue\" prop with options\nconst model = defineModel({ type: String })\n\n// emits \"update:modelValue\" when mutated\nmodel.value = 'hello'\n\n// declares \"count\" prop, consumed by parent via v-model:count\nconst count = defineModel('count')\n// OR: declares \"count\" prop with options\nconst count = defineModel('count', { type: Number, default: 0 })\n\nfunction inc() {\n  // emits \"update:count\" when mutated\n  count.value++\n}</pre>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">WARNING</strong><p>If you have a <code>default</code> value for <code>defineModel</code> prop and you don't provide any value for this prop from the parent component, it can cause a de-synchronization between parent and child components.

This is similar to the bubbling mechanism of native DOM events.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the <code>errorCaptured</code> hook itself throws an error, both this error and the original captured error are sent to <code>app.config.errorHandler</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>An <code>errorCaptured</code> hook can return <code>false</code> to prevent the error from propagating further. This is essentially saying \"this error has been handled and should be ignored.\" It will prevent any additional <code>errorCaptured</code> hooks or <code>app.config.errorHandler</code> from being invoked for this error.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Error Capturing Caveats</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>In components with async <code>setup()</code> function (with top-level <code>await</code>) Vue <strong>will always</strong> try to render component template, even if <code>setup()</code> throwed error. This will likely cause more errors because during render component's template might try to access non-existing properties of failed <code>setup()</code> context. When capturing errors in such components, be ready to handle errors from both failed async <code>setup()</code> (they will always come first) and failed render process.</p></li>\n<li><p> Replacing errored child component in parent component deep inside <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code> will cause hydration mismatches in SSR. Instead, try to separate logic that can possibly throw from child <code>setup()</code> into separate function and execute it in the parent component's <code>setup()</code>, where you can safely <code>try/catch</code> the execution process and make replacement if needed before rendering the actual child component.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"rendertracked\" tabindex=\"-1\">renderTracked  </h2>\n<p>Called when a reactive dependency has been tracked by the component's render effect.</p>\n<p><strong>This hook is development-mode-only and not called during server-side rendering.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Type</strong></p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface ComponentOptions {\n  renderTracked?(this: ComponentPublicInstance, e: DebuggerEvent): void\n}\n\ntype DebuggerEvent = {\n  effect: ReactiveEffect\n  target: object\n  type: TrackOpTypes /* 'get' | 'has' | 'iterate' */\n  key: any\n}</pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>See also</strong> <a href=\"../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth\">Reactivity in Depth</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"rendertriggered\" tabindex=\"-1\">renderTriggered  </h2>\n<p>Called when a reactive dependency triggers the component's render effect to be re-run.</p>\n<p><strong>This hook is development-mode-only and not called during server-side rendering.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Type</strong></p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface ComponentOptions {\n  renderTriggered?(this: ComponentPublicInstance, e: DebuggerEvent): void\n}\n\ntype DebuggerEvent = {\n  effect: ReactiveEffect\n  target: object\n  type: TriggerOpTypes /* 'set' | 'add' | 'delete' | 'clear' */\n  key: any\n  newValue?: any\n  oldValue?: any\n  oldTarget?: Map&lt;any, any&gt; | Set&lt;any&gt;\n}</pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>See also</strong> <a href=\"../guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth\">Reactivity in Depth</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"activated\" tabindex=\"-1\">activated </h2>\n<p>Called after the component instance is inserted into the DOM as part of a tree cached by <a href=\"built-in-components#keepalive\"><code>&lt;KeepAlive&gt;</code></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>This hook is not called during server-side rendering.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Type</strong></p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface ComponentOptions {\n  activated?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): void\n}</pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>See also</strong> <a href=\"../guide/built-ins/keep-alive#lifecycle-of-cached-instance\">Guide - Lifecycle of Cached Instance</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"deactivated\" tabindex=\"-1\">deactivated </h2>\n<p>Called after the component instance is removed from the DOM as part of a tree cached by <a href=\"built-in-components#keepalive\"><code>&lt;KeepAlive&gt;</code></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>This hook is not called during server-side rendering.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Type</strong></p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface ComponentOptions {\n  deactivated?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): void\n}</pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>See also</strong> <a href=\"../guide/built-ins/keep-alive#lifecycle-of-cached-instance\">Guide - Lifecycle of Cached Instance</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"serverprefetch\" tabindex=\"-1\">serverPrefetch  </h2>\n<p>Async function to be resolved before the component instance is to be rendered on the server.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Type</strong></p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">interface ComponentOptions {\n  serverPrefetch?(this: ComponentPublicInstance): Promise&lt;any&gt;\n}</pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Details</strong></p>\n<p>If the hook returns a Promise, the server renderer will wait until the Promise is resolved before rendering the component.</p>\n<p>This hook is only called during server-side rendering can be used to perform server-only data fetching.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      data: null\n    }\n  },\n  async serverPrefetch() {\n    // component is rendered as part of the initial request\n    // pre-fetch data on server as it is faster than on the client\n    this.data = await fetchOnServer(/* ... */)\n  },\n  async mounted() {\n    if (!this.data) {\n      // if data is null on mount, it means the component\n      // is dynamically rendered on the client.

Can be used on both elements and components. The directive expects a fixed-length array of dependency values to compare for the memoization. If every value in the array was the same as last render, then updates for the entire sub-tree will be skipped. For example:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div v-memo=\"[valueA, valueB]\"&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>When the component re-renders, if both <code>valueA</code> and <code>valueB</code> remain the same, all updates for this <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and its children will be skipped. In fact, even the Virtual DOM VNode creation will also be skipped since the memoized copy of the sub-tree can be reused.</p>\n<p>It is important to specify the memoization array correctly, otherwise we may skip updates that should indeed be applied. <code>v-memo</code> with an empty dependency array (<code>v-memo=\"[]\"</code>) would be functionally equivalent to <code>v-once</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Usage with <code>v-for</code></strong></p>\n<p><code>v-memo</code> is provided solely for micro optimizations in performance-critical scenarios and should be rarely needed. The most common case where this may prove helpful is when rendering large <code>v-for</code> lists (where <code>length &gt; 1000</code>):</p>\n<pre data-language=\"template\">&lt;div v-for=\"item in list\" :key=\"item.id\" v-memo=\"[item.id === selected]\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;ID: {{ item.id }} - selected: {{ item.id === selected }}&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;...more child nodes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>When the component's <code>selected</code> state changes, a large amount of VNodes will be created even though most of the items remained exactly the same. The <code>v-memo</code> usage here is essentially saying \"only update this item if it went from non-selected to selected, or the other way around\". This allows every unaffected item to reuse its previous VNode and skip diffing entirely. Note we don't need to include <code>item.id</code> in the memo dependency array here since Vue automatically infers it from the item's <code>:key</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">WARNING</strong><p>When using <code>v-memo</code> with <code>v-for</code>, make sure they are used on the same element. <strong><code>v-memo</code> does not work inside <code>v-for</code>.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p><code>v-memo</code> can also be used on components to manually prevent unwanted updates in certain edge cases where the child component update check has been de-optimized. But again, it is the developer's responsibility to specify correct dependency arrays to avoid skipping necessary updates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"#v-once\">v-once</a></li></ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"v-cloak\" tabindex=\"-1\">v-cloak </h2>\n<p>Used to hide un-compiled template until it is ready.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Does not expect expression</strong></p></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Details</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This directive is only needed in no-build-step setups.</strong></p>\n<p>When using in-DOM templates, there can be a \"flash of un-compiled templates\": the user may see raw mustache tags until the mounted component replaces them with rendered content.</p>\n<p><code>v-cloak</code> will remain on the element until the associated component instance is mounted.

Adding new properties to <code>this.$data</code> is possible, but it is <strong>not</strong> recommended. If the desired value of a property is not yet available then an empty value such as <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code> should be included as a placeholder to ensure that Vue knows that the property exists.</p>\n<p>Properties that start with <code>_</code> or <code>$</code> will <strong>not</strong> be proxied on the component instance because they may conflict with Vue's internal properties and API methods. You will have to access them as <code>this.$data._property</code>.</p>\n<p>It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to return objects with their own stateful behavior like browser API objects and prototype properties.

Component props can be declared in two forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple form using an array of strings</li>\n<li>Full form using an object where each property key is the name of the prop, and the value is the prop's type (a constructor function) or advanced options.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With object-based syntax, each prop can further define the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><code>type</code></strong>: Can be one of the following native constructors: <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, <code>Array</code>, <code>Object</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>Function</code>, <code>Symbol</code>, any custom constructor function or an array of those. In development mode, Vue will check if a prop's value matches the declared type, and will throw a warning if it doesn't. See <a href=\"../guide/components/props#prop-validation\">Prop Validation</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>Also note that a prop with <code>Boolean</code> type affects its value casting behavior in both development and production.

This is similar to the style encapsulation found in Shadow DOM. It comes with some caveats, but doesn't require any polyfills. It is achieved by using PostCSS to transform the following:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;style scoped&gt;\n.example {\n  color: red;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"example\"&gt;hi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>Into the following:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;style&gt;\n.example[data-v-f3f3eg9] {\n  color: red;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"example\" data-v-f3f3eg9&gt;hi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"child-component-root-elements\" tabindex=\"-1\">Child Component Root Elements </h3>\n<p>With <code>scoped</code>, the parent component's styles will not leak into child components.

Due to the way browsers render various CSS selectors, <code>p { color: red }</code> will be many times slower when scoped (i.e. when combined with an attribute selector). If you use classes or ids instead, such as in <code>.example { color: red }</code>, then you virtually eliminate that performance hit.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Be careful with descendant selectors in recursive components!</strong> For a CSS rule with the selector <code>.a .b</code>, if the element that matches <code>.a</code> contains a recursive child component, then all <code>.b</code> in that child component will be matched by the rule.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"css-modules\" tabindex=\"-1\">CSS Modules </h2>\n<p>A <code>&lt;style module&gt;</code> tag is compiled as <a href=\"https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CSS Modules</a> and exposes the resulting CSS classes to the component as an object under the key of <code>$style</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;p :class=\"$style.red\"&gt;This should be red&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;style module&gt;\n.red {\n  color: red;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre>\n<p>The resulting classes are hashed to avoid collision, achieving the same effect of scoping the CSS to the current component only.</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CSS Modules spec</a> for more details such as <a href=\"https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/blob/master/docs/composition.md#exceptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">global exceptions</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/blob/master/docs/composition.md#composition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">composition</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"custom-inject-name\" tabindex=\"-1\">Custom Inject Name </h3>\n<p>You can customize the property key of the injected classes object by giving the <code>module</code> attribute a value:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;p :class=\"classes.red\"&gt;red&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;style module=\"classes\"&gt;\n.red {\n  color: red;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre>\n<h3 id=\"usage-with-composition-api\" tabindex=\"-1\">Usage with Composition API </h3>\n<p>The injected classes can be accessed in <code>setup()</code> and <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code> via the <code>useCssModule</code> API.

However, this won't be compatible with native HTML elements, such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>.

Please read about <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/369#discussioncomment-5059028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the reasoning here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you still intend to use it, it is now available via the <a href=\"https://vue-macros.sxzz.moe/features/reactivity-transform.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue Macros</a> plugin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">Composition-API-specific</strong><p>Reactivity Transform is a Composition-API-specific feature and requires a build step.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"refs-vs-reactive-variables\" tabindex=\"-1\">Refs vs. Reactive Variables </h2>\n<p>Ever since the introduction of the Composition API, one of the primary unresolved questions is the use of refs vs. reactive objects. It's easy to lose reactivity when destructuring reactive objects, while it can be cumbersome to use <code>.value</code> everywhere when using refs. Also, <code>.value</code> is easy to miss if not using a type system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity-transform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vue Reactivity Transform</a> is a compile-time transform that allows us to write code like this:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"javascript\">&lt;script setup&gt;\nlet count = $ref(0)\n\nconsole.log(count)\n\nfunction increment() {\n  count++\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;button @click=\"increment\"&gt;{{ count }}&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</pre>\n<p>The <code>$ref()</code> method here is a <strong>compile-time macro</strong>: it is not an actual method that will be called at runtime. Instead, the Vue compiler uses it as a hint to treat the resulting <code>count</code> variable as a <strong>reactive variable.</strong></p>\n<p>Reactive variables can be accessed and re-assigned just like normal variables, but these operations are compiled into refs with <code>.value</code>. For example, the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> part of the above component is compiled into:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref } from 'vue'\n\nlet count = ref(0)\n\nconsole.log(count.value)\n\nfunction increment() {\n  count.value++\n}</pre>\n<p>Every reactivity API that returns refs will have a <code>$</code>-prefixed macro equivalent. These APIs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"../../api/reactivity-core#ref\"><code>ref</code></a> -&gt; <code>$ref</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"../../api/reactivity-core#computed\"><code>computed</code></a> -&gt; <code>$computed</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"../../api/reactivity-advanced#shallowref\"><code>shallowRef</code></a> -&gt; <code>$shallowRef</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"../../api/reactivity-advanced#customref\"><code>customRef</code></a> -&gt; <code>$customRef</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"../../api/reactivity-utilities#toref\"><code>toRef</code></a> -&gt; <code>$toRef</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These macros are globally available and do not need to be imported when Reactivity Transform is enabled, but you can optionally import them from <code>vue/macros</code> if you want to be more explicit:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { $ref } from 'vue/macros'\n\nlet count = $ref(0)</pre>\n<h2 id=\"destructuring-with\" tabindex=\"-1\">Destructuring with <code>$()</code> </h2>\n<p>It is common for a composition function to return an object of refs, and use destructuring to retrieve these refs. For this purpose, reactivity transform provides the <strong><code>$()</code></strong> macro:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { useMouse } from '@vueuse/core'\n\nconst { x, y } = $(useMouse())\n\nconsole.log(x, y)</pre>\n<p>Compiled output:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { toRef } from 'vue'\nimport { useMouse } from '@vueuse/core'\n\nconst __temp = useMouse(),\n  x = toRef(__temp, 'x'),\n  y = toRef(__temp, 'y')\n\nconsole.log(x.value, y.value)</pre>\n<p>Note that if <code>x</code> is already a ref, <code>toRef(__temp, 'x')</code> will simply return it as-is and no additional ref will be created. If a destructured value is not a ref (e.g. a function), it will still work - the value will be wrapped in a ref so the rest of the code works as expected.</p>\n<p><code>$()</code> destructure works on both reactive objects <strong>and</strong> plain objects containing refs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"convert-existing-refs-to-reactive-variables-with\" tabindex=\"-1\">Convert Existing Refs to Reactive Variables with <code>$()</code> </h2>\n<p>In some cases we may have wrapped functions that also return refs. However, the Vue compiler won't be able to know ahead of time that a function is going to return a ref. In such cases, the <code>$()</code> macro can also be used to convert any existing refs into reactive variables:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">function myCreateRef() {\n  return ref(0)\n}\n\nlet count = $(myCreateRef())</pre>\n<h2 id=\"reactive-props-destructure\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reactive Props Destructure </h2>\n<p>There are two pain points with the current <code>defineProps()</code> usage in <code>&lt;script setup&gt;</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Similar to <code>.value</code>, you need to always access props as <code>props.x</code> in order to retain reactivity. This means you cannot destructure <code>defineProps</code> because the resulting destructured variables are not reactive and will not update.</p></li>\n<li><p>When using the <a href=\"../../api/sfc-script-setup#type-only-props-emit-declarations\">type-only props declaration</a>, there is no easy way to declare default values for the props. We introduced the <code>withDefaults()</code> API for this exact purpose, but it's still clunky to use.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can address these issues by applying a compile-time transform when <code>defineProps</code> is used with destructuring, similar to what we saw earlier with <code>$()</code>:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"html\">&lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\n  interface Props {\n    msg: string\n    count?: number\n    foo?: string\n  }\n\n  const {\n    msg,\n    // default value just works\n    count = 1,\n    // local aliasing also just works\n    // here we are aliasing `props.foo` to `bar`\n    foo: bar\n  } = defineProps&lt;Props&gt;()\n\n  watchEffect(() =&gt; {\n    // will log whenever the props change\n    console.log(msg, count, bar)\n  })\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<p>The above will be compiled into the following runtime declaration equivalent:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">export default {\n  props: {\n    msg: { type: String, required: true },\n    count: { type: Number, default: 1 },\n    foo: String\n  },\n  setup(props) {\n    watchEffect(() =&gt; {\n      console.log(props.msg, props.count, props.foo)\n    })\n  }\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"retaining-reactivity-across-function-boundaries\" tabindex=\"-1\">Retaining Reactivity Across Function Boundaries </h2>\n<p>While reactive variables relieve us from having to use <code>.value</code> everywhere, it creates an issue of \"reactivity loss\" when we pass reactive variables across function boundaries. This can happen in two cases:</p>\n<h3 id=\"passing-into-function-as-argument\" tabindex=\"-1\">Passing into function as argument </h3>\n<p>Given a function that expects a ref as an argument, e.g.:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">function trackChange(x: Ref&lt;number&gt;) {\n  watch(x, (x) =&gt; {\n    console.log('x changed!')\n  })\n}\n\nlet count = $ref(0)\ntrackChange(count) // doesn't work!</pre>\n<p>The above case will not work as expected because it compiles to:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">let count = ref(0)\ntrackChange(count.value)</pre>\n<p>Here <code>count.value</code> is passed as a number, whereas <code>trackChange</code> expects an actual ref. This can be fixed by wrapping <code>count</code> with <code>$$()</code> before passing it:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"diff\">let count = $ref(0)\n- trackChange(count)\n+ trackChange($$(count))</pre>\n<p>The above compiles to:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">import { ref } from 'vue'\n\nlet count = ref(0)\ntrackChange(count)</pre>\n<p>As we can see, <code>$$()</code> is a macro that serves as an <strong>escape hint</strong>: reactive variables inside <code>$$()</code> will not get <code>.value</code> appended.</p>\n<h3 id=\"returning-inside-function-scope\" tabindex=\"-1\">Returning inside function scope </h3>\n<p>Reactivity can also be lost if reactive variables are used directly in a returned expression:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">function useMouse() {\n  let x = $ref(0)\n  let y = $ref(0)\n\n  // listen to mousemove...\n\n  // doesn't work!\n  return {\n    x,\n    y\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>The above return statement compiles to:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">return {\n  x: x.value,\n  y: y.value\n}</pre>\n<p>In order to retain reactivity, we should be returning the actual refs, not the current value at return time.</p>\n<p>Again, we can use <code>$$()</code> to fix this. In this case, <code>$$()</code> can be used directly on the returned object - any reference to reactive variables inside the <code>$$()</code> call will retain the reference to their underlying refs:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">function useMouse() {\n  let x = $ref(0)\n  let y = $ref(0)\n\n  // listen to mousemove...\n\n  // fixed\n  return $$({\n    x,\n    y\n  })\n}</pre>\n<h3 id=\"using-on-destructured-props\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using <code>$$()</code> on destructured props </h3>\n<p><code>$$()</code> works on destructured props since they are reactive variables as well. The compiler will convert it with <code>toRef</code> for efficiency:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">const { count } = defineProps&lt;{ count: number }&gt;()\n\npassAsRef($$(count))</pre>\n<p>compiles to:</p>\n<pre data-language=\"js\">setup(props) {\n  const __props_count = toRef(props, 'count')\n  passAsRef(__props_count)\n}</pre>\n<h2 id=\"typescript-integration\" tabindex=\"-1\">TypeScript Integration  </h2>\n<p>Vue provides typings for these macros (available globally) and all types will work as expected. There are no incompatibilities with standard TypeScript semantics, so the syntax will work with all existing tooling.</p>\n<p>This also means the macros can work in any files where valid JS / TS are allowed - not just inside Vue SFCs.</p>\n<p>Since the macros are available globally, their types need to be explicitly referenced (e.g. in a <code>env.d.ts</code> file):</p>\n<pre data-language=\"ts\">/// &lt;reference types=\"vue/macros-global\" /&gt;</pre>\n<p>When explicitly importing the macros from <code>vue/macros</code>, the type will work without declaring the globals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"explicit-opt-in\" tabindex=\"-1\">Explicit Opt-in </h2>\n<div class=\"danger custom-block\">\n<strong class=\"custom-block-title\">No longer supported in core</strong><p>The following only applies up to Vue version 3.3 and below.
